Choose from four unique, varied factions and wage war your way – mounting a campaign of conquest to save or destroy a vast and vivid fantasy world.

Total War: WARHAMMER II offers hundreds of hours of gameplay and no two games are the same. World-Spanning ConquestEngage in statecraft, diplomacy, exploration and build your empire, turn by turn. Capture, build and manage teeming settlements and recruit vast armies. Level up Legendary Lords and Heroes and arm them with mythical weapons and armour. Negotiate alliances or declare Total War to subjugate any that stand between you and your goal. Epic Real-Time BattlesCommand thousands-strong legions of soldiers in intense tactical battles. Send forth ferocious, twisted monsters, fire-breathing dragons and harness powerful magic. Utilise military strategies, lay ambushes, or use brute force to turn the tide of combat and lead your forces to victory.The second in a trilogy and sequel to the award-winning Total War: WARHAMMER, Total War: WARHAMMER II brings players a breath-taking new narrative campaign, set across the vast continents of Lustria, Ulthuan, Naggaroth and the Southlands. The Great Vortex Campaign builds pace to culminate in a definitive and climactic endgame, an experience unlike any other Total War title to date.Playing as one of 8 Legendary Lords across 4 iconic races from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, players must succeed in performing a series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt The Great Vortex, while foiling the progress of the other races. Each Legendary Lord has a unique geographical starting position, and each race offers a distinctive new playstyle with unique campaign mechanics, narrative, methods of war, armies, monsters, Lores of Magic, legendary characters, and staggering new battlefield army abilities.Shortly after launch, owners of both the original game and Total War™ WARHAMMER II will gain access to the colossal third campaign. Exploring a single open-world epic map covering the Old World and the New World, players may embark on monumental campaigns as any owned Race from both titles.Conquer the world, togetherEach of the Races in Total War™ WARHAMMER II will be playable in single and multiplayer campaign, plus custom and multiplayer battles. As the two Legendary Lords for each race all have their own unique campaign start positions, you’ll be able to play a 2-player co-op campaign as the same race. If you own both parts 1 and 2, you’ll be able to play in multiplayer as any of the races you own.  The World of Total War: WARHAMMER IIMillennia ago, besieged by a Chaos invasion, a conclave of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin.Powerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor. Prince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent.Atop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria. He, too, is intent on preventing cataclysm, though the methods of The Old Ones must prevail. The Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes spew forth from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks. He tastes great weakness in the vortex – and great opportunity in its demise.Meanwhile the Skaven, led by Queek Headtaker, stir in their foetid subterranean tunnels. There they multiply unchecked and look hungrily towards the surface, their motives obscured. The time for revelation is nigh…Four races, four outcomes, a single goal: control of the Great Vortex, for good or ill."}

Will you go all in with an aggro deck, or try to contain the board with a control deck? Or will you try to sneak in some sublimely ingenious combos? It’s entirely up to you.\n\n- Easy to get into:\nLearn the basics by playing through our extensive singleplayer story mode before taking on other players in our multiplayer modes. Be sure to pick up your free card packs after you’ve finished playing through the tutorial – just go to your Crate from the main menu to pick them up.

Every card is also fully-voiced, in English and Japanese, as is the singleplayer storyline.\n\n- A great community:\nAnd last but not least, we have some amazing fans. We’ve got memes, we’ve got streams, and we have much, much more to offer than the average card game. Community tournaments and e-sports broadcasts take place every week, and there are a ton of deck-building resources online in case you get stuck.

Those who did not die in the first few days, were plagued by hallucinations and headaches, many people went mad, others and committed suicide. The source of the disease could not be detected but the cities that were once the vibrant social and economic beacons of humanity were left ravaged and deserted.Survivors gradually began to change — after fifteen years of transformation, the changes became visible. The most noticeable metamorphosis occurred in the eyes of the affected — some began to glow, while others resembled black holes. To hide their unnatural looks and conceal the mutation, people started wearing padded clothing and sunglasses.Twenty years have passed after ‘Crossout’. Humans still remember their life before the disaster. As always, there are groups trying to recover the old world, while others enjoy the chaos and destruction. But there are those who are not human any more. They hide their faces behind masks, and their motives are unknown."}

Our soft-body physics engine simulates every component of a vehicle in real time, resulting in realistic, dynamic behavior.                                        The driving feel is authentic and visceral, and crashes are realistic and violent; yet the physics are accessible enough to drive with a keyboard or gamepad while still being authentic with a full racing wheel with uncompromising realism.Environments and vehicles in BeamNG.drive are hand-crafted with passionate attention to detail. With years of meticulous design, research, and experience, we authentically recreate the feeling and excitement of real world driving.We are a small team from around the world with no obligations to publishers or outside interests. Our users and modding community are our first priority. Help us make BeamNG.drive the ultimate driving experience and discover what an open and uncompromising soft-body vehicle simulator can be.Why is BeamNG.drive the game for you?As an open world vehicle simulator, BeamNG.drive will cover a large array of vehicular disciplines - everything from a delivery mission in a box truck to a high speed rally race or a destruction derby. The vehicle customization and detail will allow you to make your car or truck all your own - fix it up, upgrade it, or strip away body panels to reduce weight. There are a lot of different types of gameplay we want to implement beyond just racing and crashing, such as police chases, stunt challenges, and other specialized minigames. Eventually we would like to have some kind of single player open world career mode, with persistent vehicle ownership and procedurally generated used vehicles to buy and events to run them in.In some ways, BeamNG.drive is about doing anything you want with a car or truck - the stuff other games don't let you do. You can go off-roading in a family sedan or hurl a delivery truck around a racing circuit, all with beautiful soft-body simulation physics. You can mod those same vehicles to be racing beasts, derby monsters, or off-road behemoths - or just thrash them stock. At the end of the day, BeamNG.drive gives you the gameplay you want, and doesn't force you to do anything that you don't think is fun or interesting.The future of the game and our physics engineAs we optimize our game and computer technology improves, the amount of vehicles which can be simultaneously simulated at a smooth framerate will increase. Right now you can run 4 to 6 cars at one time on a high end quad-core processor. Each vehicle has around 400 nodes and 4000 beams, all being simulated 2000 times per second. We hope to expand the number of simultaneous vehicles possible to at least 8 with a mid-range processor.We will also look towards having multiplayer in the future, but it may be some time before we can create the multiplayer experience everyone is expecting. We are well aware of the demand for multiplayer and we want it just as much as you, but for the short term we are focusing on the single player career mode, various driving events, fixing bugs, and creating more content. It is feasible that we could implement local and/or same PC multiplayer in the interim.Also, the possibilities extend beyond land vehicles. Users in our community have already made planes and helicopters that fly purely with the existing vehicle aerodynamic physics, with no cheating whatsoever. BeamNG can simulate aircraft in a very authentic way due to its soft-body physics. All the flex that happens to a real plane's airframe arises naturally in BeamNG, and the consequences of excessive stress are also modeled. Fly too fast and your wings will start to bend and rip off. The potential for the BeamNG physics engine is huge.Alpha Access Features    All future updates to BeamNG.drive included for free (alpha, beta), also including the final game    Soft-body physics sandbox    19 detailed, customizable, destructible vehicles, with more to come    10 terrains to explore and drive across, with more to come    Frequent updates adding terrains, vehicles, features, gameplay, and bug fixes    Full modding and content creation capabilities - make maps and vehicles, and script gameplay    Use the built-in terrain editor and any 3D modeling, image editing, and text editing software    Online authentication is only necessary to update; the game itself does not need an internet connection to run.Alpha TestersUsers that already entered the alpha testing via our website can get a free Steam key.Our goalsOur main focus is on how things move rather than how things look on the screen. We aim to bring our expertise in real time soft-body physics and soft-body physics model design to the forefront of game physics simulation, making available the technology and know-how to as a wide an audience as possible. To achieve this, we are designing the engine and corresponding assets, so as to be independent of the underlying game engine and operating system.Right now the physics engine is running on a multicore CPU configuration, but we are also in the process of supporting GPUs via OpenCL.Our missionTo have realistic, accurate, destructible, and malleable physics everywhere. To make anything possible.More FeedbackMore Feedback can be found there: http://www.beamng.com/content/119-FeedbackContact UsYou can get in touch with us in several ways:     Use our forums: http://www.beamng.com/forum/     Via email: http://www.beamng.com/contactus/ or support@beamng.com     Follow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/beamng     Subscribe to our YouTube channel: http://youtube.com/user/beamng     Visit our Facebook page: http://facebook.com/BeamNGPhysics"}

Construct your own republic and transform a poor country into a rich industrial superpower!", "discount_price": 16.49, "price": 21.99, "sentiment": "Very Positive", "percent_positive": 83, "n_reviews": 2515, "early_access": true, "about": "Manage all aspects of your own republic with planned economy, including mining resources, manufacturing goods, construction, investments, and citizens too.Create your own industrial complexes with loading and unloading stations, storage, warehouses, and factories.Build the infrastructure and manage its traffic, including roads, railways, sidewalks, conveyors, wiring, and pipelines. Wisely place and connect factories, houses and warehouses, and make the most efficient connections.Plan and build the living areas with everything your citizens may need to live their happy life, such as playgrounds, cinema s, taverns, and shops.Send your citizens to the mine to get coal, iron and other natural resources; or send them to the fields to pick up the crops; or take them to factories to produce manufactured goods.Sell and purchase resources and goods from western countries or other soviet countries to get dollars or rubles and buy the products or resources you need ... or invest in new infrastructure or buildings.Enjoy authentic soviet buildings and vehicles, as well as realistic landscapes of the 60's to the 90's.Play the way you want! You can focus on getting natural resources or products and trade them for money; or you can build a self-sufficient republic; or you can just use the easy sandbox mode with unlimited money/resources and just enjoy building something live.Economic simulation. Prices of resources on the global market are changing over time as you play –one day you can sell or purchase steel for a $100 per ton, but in a few months the cost can rise to $200 or decrease to $50. The price of everything is connected to the cost of work and resources.Increasing difficulty.As prices change, the demands of the citizens also change, and you will need more resources to keep them happy and force them to work.RESOURCES &amp; INDUSTRYThere are, right now, over 30 commodities you can mine, transport and manufacture. If you want to get clothes you will first need to get resources to create a fabric, then you will need a clothing factory where the clothes will be manufactured from this fabric. You can then transport the finished clothes into shops where your citizens can buy them.Every commodity has a specific requirement,so if you would like to load oil into the tank train-car you will need a special pumping loading station. If you need to load gravel into a dumper truck you need a special loading station where the gravel comes from conveyors into the truck. Liquid resources like oil or fuel can be stored only in tanks, while resources like wood, steel, or prefabricated concrete panels can be stored outside in the open space. Using a crane for these will increase loading/unloading speed. Goods like clothes, food, etc. can be stored in warehouses.WORKERS AND THEIRS DEMANDSEvery worker/citizen goes to work each day. If they work for you, they have demands. At the start of the game they are satisfied just with food, but as a time goes on they may have more demands like meat, clothes, alcohol or electronics. Also, to have happy workers you need places where they can spend their leisure time – cinema, playgrounds, taverns, etc.Every worker has an education level. They can go to school or college to improve this level. If their education is too low they cannot work; if their education is high enough they can be a teacher, or researcher, or work in factories with special requirements.TRANSPORTATIONYou have many options for how you will manage resources and goods transportation. If you get raw iron ore from a mine, you need to process it. Then you need to transport it somehow into a steel mill to produce steel. You can build the processing plant and steel mill near to the mine and transport it all by conveyors, or you can transport iron ore into a steel mill by train fora longer distance. It is up to you to decide from where the workers will go into the factories. You can create residential zones and transport workers by buses or trains to industrial areas. You can also build residential buildings near the factories so that workers will able to walk to the factory. But don't forget that a worker will need to purchase food and enjoy their free time, so again it is up to you to decide whether to build those facilities near their home or whether you will transport them somehow to shops or places to spend their free time.ECONOMY SIMULATION The game simulates the economy system. There are no fixed prices! Costs of everything are defined by the economic situation. For example, the cost of steel is calculated from the price of iron, coal and work, and also partially from the cost of steel mill construction.You purchase or sell commodities for money (dollars or rubles). But be careful, as it is possible that if you buy or sell for high values you will affect the price of the commodity on the market. You may be able to purchase for a higher price or sell it cheaper.As time increases, so does complexity. Some resources or products may become more expensive (as, for example, less human work is needed with advanced technologies), so later with more complexity, it may be necessary to be as self-sufficient as possible."}

Hunt. Grow. Survive.", "price": 19.99, "sentiment": "Mostly Positive", "percent_positive": 70, "n_reviews": 11510, "early_access": true, "about": "The Isle: A World Designed to Kill YouThe Isle is intended to be a gritty, open-world survival horror game. Explore vast landscapes of dense forest and open plains, traverse treacherous mountains and wade through dark swamps where horrors lurk. Hidden within are ruins that hold insight as to what came before. Through it all, keep in mind there is only one goal: survive. There is little in the way of hand holding or ulterior precepts to alter play styles or purpose. It's kill or be killed. In the end, the only one you can trust is yourself. Over the course of development the islands and their inhabitants will radically change, ever-evolving as players themselves learn how to flourish and thrive. Your mistakes will be punished. Expect no survivors.Massive Prehistoric MultiplayerBecome the beast within. When joining The Isle, you can play as one of dozens of unique creatures, from tiny darting herbivores like Dryosaurus to blood-thirsty giants such as T. Rex or Allosaurus (with many more still to come!) As a dinosaur, you'll be the epitome of majestic, cunning and ferocious. Use your natural abilities and senses to stay off the menu and grow into a stronger, more capable creature.Engage with a living prehistoric ecosystem as you become either predator or prey on servers featuring up to 100+ players, all of them as hungry and dangerous as you. Form packs/herds, create nests, defend your offspring, hunt, and claim territory. A single mistake can spell your demise.Survival or Sandbox?The Isle's core game mode is Survival, a tense and difficult experience where you need to grow fast or die young. Dinosaurs in Survival mode progress through several life stages, starting out small and vulnerable. Use your scent ability, night vision and wits to survive long enough to grow, becoming more powerful and unlock new abilities such as nesting. Because of the time needed to develop a full character life cycle, not every creature is or will be playable in Survival, though more will be added in future updates. However, sometimes you don't want to struggle to survive, or you don't have the time to go through a dinosaur's whole life story. And that's okay. For players who want a less intense experience, Sandbox mode lets you play an expanded roster of dinosaurs (and soon humans!). You can jump right in as an adult super predator or a peaceful giant, with no major penalties or consequences from dying. We won't judge.A Global Community StoryThe Isle features a narrative told strictly through the environment, achievable only through immense cooperation among players. Are you stranded? Can you just leave? What is AE? How did the dinosaurs get here? What is the distant call that pierces the night? It will take the entire community to answer these mysteries and unravel the purpose to their being on The Isle, and each discovery will directly affect the future of the game's storyline.Future Development GoalsWe realize that there is a long road ahead, and a lot of work to be done to turn this into the game we want it to be. Throughout development, we will be adding a lot more to The Isle and incorporating user feedback in how we evolve the experience. Some of our planned features include:Playable aquatic and aerial creaturesEven more playable dinosaurs with complete life cyclesTwo new playable factions: modern humans &amp; the indigenousEvolve into advanced \"strain\" versions of certain dinosaursRealistic dinosaur AI that uses complex behavioursAdditional world biome types such as thick junglesDynamic aerial drop-in spawn systemGlobal in-game world questLocalization of all in-game menus &amp; textBetter accessibility &amp; customization optionsSteam Achievements, Trading Cards, EmotesMod support using Steam WorkshopAll that and more are on our radar going forward. We started with a plan of just a mere handful of playable carnivores, but based on player demand we expanded our scope, increased that number greatly and introduced herbivorous dinosaurs as well. Listening to our community has been instrumental in guiding our process and helped to correct our mistakes, and we hope that together we can transform The Isle into the ultimate dinosaur game. --AE Core TX Received----End Promotional Protocol----SiGnaL InTeRrUpt---tHEeNdISnevErTheENDisNeVeRtHeEnDIsNev-"}

Fed up with these constant attacks, the Borderland Clans called on the Empire for help – a powerful realm controlling the land from the Scarlett Mountains to Cynehelm Valley and the Hoarwood. The Western Imperial Legion was sent to face the highland raiders, and with the help of the Borderland clans Iseal and Machnar, killed High King Brendan in the battle of Wyrm’s Pass.A treaty was signed that forbade any clan from crossing into the Borderlands in return for peace.

It is a survival sandbox with crew management mechanics while its primary theme is life of German sailors. The boat is their home, but it can become their grave at any time.In UBOAT you control the crew in order to control the boat. You look after their physical and mental health, because if the sailors are hungry, tired and their spirit is low, there’s no chance of winning even a skirmish.SurvivalThe extensive damage system is a foundation of the game's survival elements. Unprecedented situations are bound to happen as the effect of received damage, testing player's creativity and ability to stay calm. You can try to save the whole crew or leave someone behind, to save the others.While your ship travels through the open seas, you will often find yourself being on your own. Use your management skills to spend resources taken on the trip optimally and in special cases try to recover them on the sea, by asking your allies for the help... or by looting wreckages of enemy ships. Disable unnecessary devices, to keep your accumulators running for longer. Tell your crew to stay in their bunks to preserve oxygen. If crew's morale is low - play with them a session of Skat or play music from nearby radio stations, to fortify their hearts.Kriegsmarine careerDuring the playthrough you will receive assignments from the Kriegsmarine headquarters. They are never linear and you may receive additional orders during them or face unexpected problems.Brave completion of assignments from the headquarters is rewarded with additional budget for the unit under your command and with acceptance of your growing reputation as an u-boat's skipper. You will need that, to upgrade your ship and keep up with enemy's technological advances. Upgrade your boat for the rewarded funds. Receive additional permissions for the reputation points. Buy new equipment - new torpedo types, sonar decoys, CO2 absorbers and much more. Send your officers on special tasks in the headquarters to, among other things, speed up a research of new technologies.Accurate simulationGame's simulation elements are very realistic, but that never comes at a cost of gameplay quality. Despite extensive simulation elements, UBOAT can be played like a regular game and complex matters can be learned later to become a better skipper for the commanded unit.Even small things like the influence of ballast in each compartment on the ship's trim (tilt) or Earth's curvature are faithfully reproduced in the game.Perfection can be achieved in many ways. Prove your management skills and swiftly assign work to your officers to speed things up. If, on the other hand, you think that if something needs to be done, it's better to do that on your own - sit behind the periscope, hydrophone or 88 mm deck gun and take matters in your own hands!"}

Composed of fast-paced 3D fighting games that began with the original DEAD OR ALIVE arcade game in 1996, and have since appeared on a multitude of consoles and arcade machines around the world. In DEAD OR ALIVE 6, the world of DOA is brought back more vibrant than ever, featuring both enhanced visuals and an updated combat systems, aimed to provide the highest possible level of new fighting entertainment. [Story]The story will follow the events of DEAD OR ALIVE 5, focusing on 2 separate main narratives; namely, the battle between “Ninja and DOATEC” versus “M.I.S.T. lead by Donovan”, and the events that occur during the 6th DEAD OR ALIVE Tournament. New side story episodes will also be added for returning characters.[The New Visuals]With the help of a new graphics engine, DOA6 aims to bring visual entertainment of fighting games to an entirely new level. The graphics are made to be both enticingly beautiful and realistic, bringing out enhanced facial expressions, such special effects as depiction of sweat and dirt on character models, and realistic hit effects.[The Triangle System]Following the tradition, fights in DEAD OR ALIVE 6 are based on a triangle system: strikes beat throws, throws beat holds, and holds beat strikes. Landing a well-timed attack of the type that beats your opponent’s attack, like landing a strike when an opponent tries to throw, will result in a Hi Counter attack and do more damage.[New Combat Mechanics - Break System]In this new title, we are introducing a new Special Move Gauge (Break Gauge) to the DEAD OR ALIVE series, adding a new dramatic strategic element to the fights. This element is made to be accessible and easy to use even for people who are new to the world of fighting games, and is activated by simply pressing the [RB] button.[Break Blow] A strong, high-damage special move that knocks your opponents down. The first part of the move also parries incoming attacks, working as both an offensive and defensive move![Break Hold] A convenient counter technique that can also be used while the player is heavily stunned. It should only be used in tight situations due to its light-damage output.[Fatal Rush]A powerful combo with a dramatic finishing move, activated by consecutively pressing the [RB] button. While it is made to be easy to use for beginner players, it can also be employed in more than one creative way by the experienced competitors.[New Danger Zones][Rumble Danger]If knocked into onlookers, they will push the player back into the center of the stage. It is a trap that combines the atmosphere of a real street fight with strategy.[Mass-Destruction]If the opponent is knocked back into a large stack of boxes or barrels with a “Break Blow” or ”Fatal Rush” it will cause a large chain-explosion. This will lead to a huge burst of damage and produces an exhilarating rush."}

Explore Earth and our neighboring worlds in the Solar System, orbit a black hole in a galaxy billions of light-years away, or visit anything in between seamlessly, with no transitions.All of time and space are yours to explore – cruise between the stars at a million times the speed of light, and accelerate time to watch the orbital motions of a thousand worlds play out before your eyes. Every planet you encounter in your journey will feature procedural 3D terrain with detailed textures. Everything you see in the sky – stars and galaxies, planets and moons, asteroids and comets, black holes and neutron stars, star clusters and nebulae – are yours to explore at the press of a button.Spacecraft with Newtonian physics and pilot-assist autopilot features (in early development but fully usable) are yours to fly anywhere in the universe in the Flight Simulator mode. SpaceEngine is also very friendly for creators of mods and add-ons – create your own planets, star systems, even galaxies, import your own spacecraft models, create custom GUI skins, and more, all easily sharable with others.With SpaceEngine, the possibilities are limitless.SpaceEngine Planetarium capabilities:AstronomyAll types of celestial objects are represented: galaxies, nebulae, stars and star clusters, planets and moons, comets and asteroids. Known celestial objects are represented using data from catalogs: galaxies (NGC/IC), stars (HIPPARCOS), star clusters, nebulae, and planets (Solar System and known extrasolar planets). Regions of space not yet cataloged feature procedurally generated objects: galaxies, stars, star clusters, nebulae, and planetary systems.ControlsYou are free to move around the universe – travel seamlessly between any object and any distance, from surface to orbit to interstellar and intergalactic space. Moving through space is as easy as \"click and go\", as well as game-style free flight using the WASD keys or a gamepad. Also, time travel is possible: you can accelerate, decelerate, or reverse the flow of time, and jump to a specified date. Detailed interactive tutorials will familiarize you with the controls.GraphicsVolumetric 3D models of galaxies and nebulae with interstellar dust clouds, and 3D landscapes on planets and stars. For many Solar System bodies, actual data from space probes is used, with huge, high-resolution texture packs available as free DLC. For unmapped and procedural planets, the surface is generated procedurally using your computer's GPU. Other features include realistic atmospheric scattering, eclipse shadows, animated auroras and comet tails, and physically-based light warping near black holes and neutron stars, with animated accretion disks and jets.PhysicsRealistic and physically-based generation of procedural objects (galaxies, star systems, planets) and their physical properties (mass, radius, temperature, atmospheric parameters, etc). The orbital motion of planets, moons, and stars in multiple-star systems are accurately calculated and displayed. Realistic space ship design concepts and physics: orbital motion, atmospheric flight model, and Alcubierre warp drive physics.Virtual realitySpaceEngine supports HTC Vive, Oculus Rift (via native library), and Windows Mixed Reality (via Steam VR). Support of VR controllers is partial: you can select objects with one controller and move around with the other one. Please note that VR support is still a work in progress, and new users should become familiar with the program in 2D before trying to use VR.SoundOriginal background music tracks made by many authors, with context-sensitive playback. Sound effects for planetary environments and space ships are in development.ToolsBuilt-in tutorials will help you start using the Planetarium. Search for celestial objects by name and search for the nearest star systems. Browse the cosmos using a scalable Universe map and planetary system chart. Saving, exporting, and importing of locations is supported, which can easily be shared between users. The program keeps an automatic journal of objects you have recently visited. Learn every detail about the objects you find using the built-in “Wiki” info system, with additional hand-written descriptions of many known objects. Display the orbital paths of celestial objects, labels and markers, constellations, and other informational tools.Multi-language supportCurrently SpaceEngine is available in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Swedish, Croatian, Czech, Polish, Russian, and Catalan languages. Many new localizations are under development. Only localizations which are 100% complete are displayed on the Steam store page, but you can enable others in-game.ModdingSpaceEngine supports creating and importing user add-ons: catalogs, models and textures for deep space objects, planets, and space ships.

No game has come closer to the replication of the Age of Sail sailing mechanics and combat.Here is what you can expect:Beautiful ships – We have been painstakingly recreating the beautiful ships of the Age of sail period. Accurate hull models, sail plans, guns, internal upgrades, historical speed trials were used in the creation of vessels. The game features 50+ ships from small cutters to large 100+ gun 1st rates allowing the player to experience every possible role of that era.Conquest and PVP ActivitiesFight on War Server – Fight for the domination of the West Indies, recreated based on 18th Century maps and navigational charts. Build ships, trade, attack enemies of your nation almost everywhere and capture their ships. Open trading outposts and levy taxes in the ports governed by your clan. Invest to turn your controlled ports into industrial hubs, shipbuilding arsenals or fortified harbours. Invite other clans of your nation into your alliance.Built for PVPAge of sail combat is a personal affair with no dirty tricks, corner camping, or hiding in bushes: you see the enemy from 20km and so do they. Just like in boxing you have to get close; and use all your tactical knowledge of wind, your ship to slug it out face to face. Broadside weight matters, but even a smaller vessel can overcome the superior enemy by focusing on the enemy weak spots.Absolutely no hackers.Hacking is a killer of fun in PVP games. From the start we have build the tech around one main goal - complete elimination of hacking from PVP. We are very proud to say that we have succeeded. Naval Action is one of the few games where hacking is made impossible by design. Every battle action is calculated on the servers, even water and wave shapes. Yes - you have heard it right: there is a special server that calculates and replicates waves to all users in battle. When fighting in Naval action you can be sure you are only facing skills and ship fittings.Other activitiesRelax on Peace Server - All nations are at peace and players cannot attack each other in Peace servers. There are no port battles and conquest, piracy or privateering. All ships can be captured from the NPCs. Peace servers are perfect for friendly peaceful gameplay.Tutorials – In-game tutorials and exams help you to grasp the basics and the subtleties of gunnery and maneuvering. Passing the final naval combat exam grants you the rank of Master and Commander, together with a frigate and other rewards to start your adventures in the West Indies.Admiralty missions – Accomplish missions for your Admiralty to earn doubloons, combat medals and reward chests. Deliver cargo or passengers, hunt specific ships, join patrol zones battles and sink as many ships as you can.Trading and privateering – Buy trading goods at low prices, haul them to distant places for high profits. Board ships and sell them and their cargo at nearby ports. Use shallow waters at your advantage to escape from larger ships.Shipbuilding and manufacturing - Build ships, upgrades and cannons, supply your clans or your nation or set up shops in free towns to sell to your enemies.  FeaturesRealistic sailing – Advanced wind and physics model provides for realistic portrayal of ship’s performance in the age of sail. Yard angles, ship angle to wind, fittings and ship condition affects speeds and turning rates. Correct tacking, boxhauling, clubhauling and other elements of realistic sailing will help you win battles in most adverse conditions. Gunnery and weapons –  Major types of naval artillery are implemented: from long guns to mortars to carronades and obusiers. Fort and land batteries will provide you with support during battles near shores. Mortar vessels can destroy fortifications, though they may require an escort. Each gun has realistic ballistics and penetration performance based on historical gun charts and admiralty tests.. Heel and wind affects the shooting distance and will require a change in tactics. Damage model – Every cannonball is tracked in the air and after it hits the target. Leaks, structural damage, torn sails, demasting, raking, fires, explosions and all other hazards that were possible in that era. Damage is positional: hit the gun and you might destroy it. Gunnery crews are placed deck by deck. Shot can pass through the balcony, ricochet of the gun, hit a crew member and then fly out of the gunport splashing into the water. Armor thickness and wood types affect strength of the hull and cannonballs will ricochet from the hulls at extreme angles. Customization – Choose economy and battle perks as you progress through higher ranks. Find knowledge books in enemy vessels and build upgrades to improve the performance of your ship. Loot or craft the shipbuilding woods that fit the characteristics you want to give to your future ship. Woods used for crafting of upgrades and equipment"}

Lobotomy Corp is a Monster Management Rogue-Lite Simulation game.Our game was inspired by the monsters from game and movies such as SCP series, Cabin in the woods and Warehouse 13. Furthermore, it was developed from the thought of “What if those monsters were real and your job is to manage them”. You will be playing as an administrator of the company which is in the management of such creatures. These monsters generate a new energy source, and your job is to collect them through giving out to your subordinates. Through this process, you can open new departments that facility allows and encounter various monsters. In the game, the player will have to go through the company’s fear and tension filled the atmosphere. “Our new technology will bring salvation to the human race.” Lobotomy corporation is a newly established energy company that extracts an infinite amount of entropy through the isolation of abnormality with our self-developed technology. This is only an impression that the public has regarding our company. You will see its reality after you have joined us.Our facility is formed of many departments just like any other companies. You will have access to various departments as you gather more energy. The more you have access to various departments, the much easier the management of abnormality will become.Furthermore, an AI ‘Angela’ and ‘Sephira’ will be by your side to support your needs for the smooth process of work. An existence you constantly have to examine and observe. We have decided to call the monsters in Lobotomy as ‘Abnormality’.You will have to try your best to keep your employees out of danger while keeping the energy extraction level at its maximum.At first, you won’t have any information on Abnormality. You will only have your eyes and the manual to guide you. Speculate which process will be most suitable for each Abnormality. After that, just pick and place your employee who is best suited for the job and wait for results. Also, you will have to gather information through giving out orders to your employees to ‘examine’ the creature. You get the power to obtain information in the process of managing Abnormality.Abnormality’s energy generation level depends on their conditions This game is NOT a tycoon.As mentioned before, Abnormality is a creature that should be handled with an extreme alert. Some of them might don’t like the idea of humans keeping them locked up in chambers. They will try to escape when they have a chance and when they do, they will destroy everything. Be it our employees or the facility.Furthermore, certain Abnormality can brainwash and corrupt our employees into their pawn. These ‘pawns’ can have a bad effect on other employees and might randomly attack the people around them. Also, they also bring down the other employees’ mentality level which might result in disobedience. You could get rid them of course, but you should consider the fact that all the information and data regarding that employee will be deleted as well. One disaster will cause another, and it will lead everything into chaos.If you do not stop them instantly, the situation will get out of hand and fall into chaos. When this situation does occur, you will have to decide whether you will gather employees to recapture the Abnormality, or destroy some part of the facility with explosives to secure the company’s safety. “Do you have any wishes, administrator?” Lobotomy corporation is divided into work procedure and the story mode. In work procedure, you will be doing your job as the company’s administrator managing the Abnormality and the energy generation level. A game’s story will follow right afterward. In Story mode, there is a dialogue with Sephira, including AI Angela, which will also appear in the work part. Through the mission they give, you will come closer to the truth hidden in the company. Furthermore, the player will be placed in a situation where they must answer or ask questions. You can also discover secrets surrounding the company and the player."}

Interact with objects, create disasters, and launch clueless creatures into orbit. This is your world, and nothing can stop you from having fun.Our goal is to bring back the features you know and love from classic god games and spice them up with fresh ideas, a modern physics engine, and stylized visuals developed by a few of our very own industry heroes.THE STORY OF A SPECIESMeet the Nuggets, a fragile and whacky species that relies on your leadership to build, research, and advance. Help them, and they will soon begin writing their own history in the stars. Every Nugget is a unique individual with a distinct set of characteristics. Just like any other living creature, Nuggets must have access to a few vital resources in order to survive. This includes water to drink, food to eat, and recreational activities to increase their happiness and quality of life. Recreational activities may include blowing stuff up. You’ve been warned.As you spend time with the Nuggets, you will begin to notice that they behave like natural, living beings. They have their own thoughts and needs, as well as the ability to act in dynamic and interesting ways. While the beginning of the game will require more management to ensure the survival of your civilization, Nuggets will slowly evolve and learn how to handle more tasks on their own, resulting in you being able to switch over to a more macro-level role and tackle even greater challenges. ORGANIC GAMEPLAYPlanets in The Universim aren’t just made up of a bunch of neatly-arranged objects; everything is linked together and plays a unique role in each planet’s ecosystem. Every tree your civilization cuts down, every resource they mine and every animal they hunt will affect the world they’re living in. A lack of trees and high levels of pollution will raise the global temperature over time, while reckless hunting or fishing might cause the extinction of some species. It’s your mission to manage how the Nuggets collect and utilize resources. What mark will you leave on the ecosystems that existed millions of years before your arrival? Will you use every available resource and expand at an unprecedented pace, or will you methodically create a more sustainable way of life for your civilization?NATURE AS YOU KNOW ITIn The Universim, nature is just as wonderful and unpredictable as ever. Every planet comes with a few surprises that are sure to challenge your civilization. From tornadoes that consume everything in their path, to thunderous earthquakes that threaten to split your civilization in two. If you treat nature poorly, it might just show you how brutal and unforgiving it can be. Each planet you encounter will have a unique underbelly. Some planets are tranquil and filled to the brim with resources, while others are barren and dangerous. Be careful out there!Something as simple as the cycle between night and day can play an important role. Wild animal attacks are more common at night, as are frequent temperature drops. Daytime offers a little more safety from the harshness of the world. With the inclusion of a full, four-season cycle, a planet’s biomes can change drastically, making it extremely difficult for Nuggets to survive brutal winters without proper preparation ahead of time."}

Battle alongside allies online in four-player co-op or go it alone in spectacular procedurally-generated landscapes to complete daring missions and collect powerful new weapons, armor, and arcane relics of legend.STORYFive years have passed since Lo Wang shattered the alliance between his deceitful former boss and the ancient gods of the shadow realm. Despite noble intentions, Lo Wang’s efforts to annihilate the darkness corrupted the world, creating a strange and savage new order where humans and demons live side by side. The once feared warrior now lives in the shifting wildlands outside the reach of his enemies and the neon glow of Zilla’s cybernetic metropolis, scratching out a meager existence as a hired sword for the local Yakuza clans. When a simple mission goes wrong, Lo Wang is drawn into a volatile conflict between a brilliant young scientist, his nemesis Orochi Zilla, and the demonic forces that have become unsettled in our world.

The community's leaders and local police have surrendered to his will. A master of intimidation and blackmail, Zuev has seized every major business in town, all of which he now controls as his own private fiefdom. An outlaw band of renegade cops refuses to bow, however. With little hope of success, they fight on — for justice, and the soul of their town. Gunfights are thrilling, but stealth is keyYou're fighting a guerilla war, out-manned and out-gunned. Use concealment and cover, approach the enemy quietly, and take them down before they can raise the alarm. You have at your disposal an arsenal of non-lethal weapons and equipment, as well as special tactical perks which you can unlock as you upgrade your rebels. True, sometimes violence seems inevitable, but when the time comes, don't hesitate: neither you nor the criminals have health bars. When someone is shot, they'll bleed out quickly, and getting a bullet in the head means instant death.Explore, scavenge, and watch your backRebel Cops features not only compact operations where you need to fight for every inch of ground, but also large, open locations to explore — the sandbox levels. Search each room, crack open safes and vaults, try to get into inaccessible areas — and, above all, grab everything that looks useful. Stay together and proceed with caution, or accept the risks, fan-out, and try to explore every corner.Take the high road, or the low roadZuev's mercilessness is the key to his power. Can you defeat him without playing by his rules? Will you answer the needs of the desperate townspeople, even if it means putting the whole operation at risk? Will you spare civilian guards who are only doing their jobs? Some say that in war, you have to do whatever it takes to survive, but remember: reputation is more valuable than money. Bad blood on the streets can easily put your good name in the mud. Merchants will refuse to do business with you, and even some of your own people might turn their backs on you."}

Campfire Games is devoted to presenting the gruesome and glorious elements of the period, while maintaining the highest level of historical accuracy and realism as is possible with the wonders of CRYENGINE. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀- Massive battles: Take part in engagements consisting of 150 players.- Tailored for line formation teamplay: Custom formation buff mechanic system rewards sticking together by lessening the suppression effects, the morale cost for the team when dying and the flag bearer respawn rate.- Historical accuracy: Period correct uniforms, weapons, manual of arms animations, battlefields, objectives &amp; drill camps.- Regimental pride: 95 researched and recreated regiments all supporting uniforms for all ranks (Private to Colonel) and player classes.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀- Immersive communication: In-game 3D voice system.- Recreated battlefields: More than 30 historically accurate skirmish areas of the Battles of Antietam and South Mountain as well as the Siege of Harpers Ferry to play on and three drill camps to perfect your formation forming abilities or simply exchange battle stories at the campfire.- Player classes: Private, NCO, Flag Bearer &amp; Officer playable from every regiment featured and covering all ranks from Private to Colonel.- Community focus: A strong company (player organized clans) focus with a dedicated company tool and forum sections devoted to in-game event creation.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀- Powerful game engine: Powered by CRYENGINE V, War of Rights is capable of providing visuals unmatched by any other Civil War game.- More than a game: War of Rights is a vision that keeps expanding its scale. The project is entirely crowdfunded and has been developed on for the past 6 years. We consider it more of an ever evolving artistic piece rather than a final product with a targeted release deadline with set features.Players in the game will be able to play on multiple battlefields of the campaign, from the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers where the Siege of Harper's Ferry took place, to the ridgelines of South Mountain, and to the meandering waters of Antietam Creek at the Battle of Antietam. Additionally, players will also be able to choose from a list of regiments that fought in each battle as well as what rank to fight as, whether they want to slog it out as a lowly private, or if you want to orchestrate the carnage and mayhem as a major general. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Uniforms and bodily features will all be customizable for other players to see as you march and fight in the lines of battle according to the tactics of the period. As a General, you will operate in your headquarters equipped with a map of the battlefield and constantly receiving reports of friendly and enemy positions. Send out new orders to the regiments to move forward, or fall back - all in real time. The orders will move down the chain of command, to the Colonels, Majors, down to the Captains in charge of the individual regiments, all of whom have the option to follow the orders of their trusted commander, or rebel against his wishes and fight as you see fit. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Each map contains a period reconstruction of the buildings, farms, forests, roads, and rocks as they were in 1862 so players can fight through the streets of Harper's Ferry, in the wooded heights of Fox's Gap at South Mountain, or in the cornfields and Bloody Lanes of Antietam. Players can feel the whiz of deadly shot and shell fly by their bodies, or hit their comrades or themselves as they scream in a bloody hail from their wounds. Limbs will fly and blood will be spilt once again as Campfire Games brings the fighting of the Civil War right to the player's computer screen! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀Will you heed the Union call against the traitors? Or will you fight to defend your family and livelihood with the Confederacy? You decide!⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀We thought it a good idea to recreate/repost our Early Access roadmap as a lot of players having joined us recently are unlikely to know what we are intending to offer as the game advances in its development. The below roadmap should be taken for what it is - a preliminary list of things we have planned for. As all plans are subject to change, there is a great chance that the list will also end up changing, however.The order of the roadmap is also subject to change as the development moves ahead. Some things listed may arrive a great deal sooner or later than what their listing order indicates.1. Bug fixes, stability improvements: This will be an ongoing focus throughout the development of the game. An alpha is never without its bugs. New content rarely comes without its fair share of bugs and issues required to fix up.2. Performance improvements: We are well aware of the performance of the alpha is needing to be improved - especially at higher playercounts. Major programming work is currently going into reworking the most expensive part of the game at high playercounts. Once finished you should all be experiencing much better framerates on populated servers.3. Expanded server moderation tools: This will allow server administrators more control to manage and configure their server using commands such as: kick,ban,change map, change skirmish area, change weather and time of day.4. End game events: Taken out just before the launch on Early Access, the end game events will be making a comeback in a more fleshed out form, specifically designed to create more memorable end game moments in cases where the question of who were the winners of the match is heavily contested.5. Improved melee: Melee is going to be receiving a much needed overhaul, including the availability of a parry move and animation kill sequences between two players (“kill-moves”) to increase the visual fidelity of close quarter fighting.6. New battlefields: The Battles of South Mountain and Shepherdstown will eventually complete the Maryland Campaign of 1862.7. Fleshed out officer order system: Additional officer commands will be introduced to allow for a greater range of tactical options.8. Musicians: Working in tandem with the officer order system, musicians will have to relay the correct calls to help make sure the orders are received down the line.9. Historical Battles mode: Besides the quicker Skirmish mode, the largest and main game mode intended for the game, known as Historical Battles, would open up the entirety of the 4x4 km battlefields for more of a complete playthrough, with a moving frontline consisting of several capture areas. This will also entail the use of the full chain of command where players take the part of Generals, using maps and couriers to direct troops across the huge battlefield.10. Player controlled artillery: The many batteries already placed on the battlefields will become player controlled once we introduce an artillery system, where players will have access to some of the most destructive and tide-turning weapons of war.11. Generals: The chain of command on the battlefield will be expanded with the addition of generals. Generals bring a tactical overview to the battle that all other classes lack, helping to command the troops when using the historical battles mode, helping to bring some order to the chaos of war.12. Cavalry: Horses are to be implemented for both cavalry units, moving artillery pieces, as well as for the high command and their couriers. The cavalry was still an important branch of the armies of the period considering the changes in technology, acting as reconnaissance and quick response units as understandings for their use developed over the period of the war.13. Final Release: Once the above features have been finished, we will be at the point that we would be just about ready for full release of the game to all and sundry! This final release would also be the point that those that had backed us originally would be getting their promised physical and digital goods. While we cannot give any definite date as to when we might get to release, we inch closer every day!"}

I’m rdein, the creator and director of Minoria.First of all, I’d like to share my excitement in announcing this project. This is a universe I care a lot for, from the setting to the characters, and it’s been a lot of fun to explore and develop its concepts during the process of game development.For the first time in many years, I started a game project set in a new universe. It felt like a breath of fresh air for me. With that said, Minoria does contain some similarities with my previous projects (especially Momodora’s latest installment, Reverie Under the Moonlight).I am proud of what we’ve been making for Minoria, and I hope you will enjoy the story and characters I’ve prepared this time around!Howdy folks, Dan here from Dangen Entertainment. It’s been hard patiently waiting for the announcement of Minoria, knowing what an amazing game it’s going to be. It combines everything I love about the Momodora games with stronger emphasis on a solemn story. I love how Bombservice is approaching the visuals this time around too--it’s a unique take that looks beautiful and shows another evolutionary step in the team’s development experience, just as previous titles have. This game is extraordinary. A must-play if you’ve got an appetite for action-platformers like I do."}

Each player mans a station in the U-boat, and the crew will need to cooperate in order to succeed in their mission. Unlike other submarine simulators, Wolfpack is designed for players to procedurally manage the submarine through direct, manual interaction with valves, levers, and instruments.Each U-boat has up to five players: The captain, the helmsman, the dive officer, the radio man, and the navigator.The radio man operates the hydrophone, radio, radio direction finder, and Enigma machine. The helmsman controls the U-boats heading and speed, and operates the torpedo data computer. The dive officer controls the depth using the dive planes, ballast and negative tanks and serves as a lookout and gunner for the deck gun and anti aircraft gun. The navigator calculates the position of the u-boat, and determines the best route to intercept enemy convoys. The captain is the commander of the U-boat, and leads the crew.Wolfpack also features a single player mode where one captain can easily manage his U-boat solo. Plus, it is easy to start a mission solo and allow other players to join the battle in their own subs as part of a wolfpack. The captains can use the U-boat radio to communicate with each other just like the real U-boats did.All stations and instruments in the U-boat are carefully modeled after original pictures and sources, and kept as realistic as possible without compromising usability.

I am the sole developer of the project, which I work  on in my spare time as a passion project. I feel this is important to mention, so that those considering playing the game can make a more informed purchase decision. A full detailed list of the updates since launch can be viewed here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/418030/allnews/.Goals of the project:The aim is to integrate the kinds of base-resource micro-management typically found in RTS titles, into a boots-on-the-ground shooter. Each base has an underlying economy of power and raw materials that must be maintained and expanded in order to rise in dominance.

Take your time. Think ahead. Get the job done.", "price": 16.79, "sentiment": "Mostly Positive", "percent_positive": 78, "n_reviews": 812, "early_access": true, "about": "In GROUND BRANCH, you will play as the elite paramilitary arm of the CIA's Special Activities Center/Special Operations Group (SAC/SOG) and lead other special operations forces through challenging deniable ops all over the globe. With deliberate, calculated and unforgiving gameplay, GROUND BRANCH aims to be the true rebirth of the tactical realism genre of the late '90s and early 2000s. Powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 4, GB puts the \"tactical\" back in \"tactical shooter\"—no compromises.▶ TRUE FIRST PERSONGROUND BRANCH's unique True First-Person System improves world immersion and awareness of your surroundings, providing zero disconnect between your view and your character's physical presence in the environment. See your foot sticking out of cover? Better tuck it in—enemies may be able to see it (and shoot it) too, but only if their line of sight and muzzle are verifiably unobstructed. Cameras are placed at the character's eyes and bullets originate from the weapon's muzzle. In GROUND BRANCH, what you see is what you get.A minimal HUD with multiple optional elements ensures that vital information is available, but never a constant obstacle to either immersion or your field of view.▶ UNPRECEDENTED CUSTOMIZATIONSay goodbye to pre-defined kits and fully customize your character and gear from basic appearance and outfit to in-depth vest and weapon platform customization, down to individual pouch and attachment placement. What you bring to your mission is determined only by your loadout choice, with realistic consequences: With the upcoming encumbrance and stamina system, too much equipment will impact your character's speed and performance; place a scope too forward on the rail and your sight picture will be too small; bring a long rifle into CQB and weapon collision may prove a hindrance.Forget unlocks, microtransactions and loot boxes. Ground Branch operators get all the right tools for the job straight away—courtesy of the Agency.▶ OPERATE, COOPERATEWhether in 8-player co-op or 8v8 adversarial game modes, GROUND BRANCH's unforgiving gameplay makes careful and calculated teamwork essential. Gather your teammates and practice in full-featured training areas, including shooting ranges with dynamic targets and customizable killhouses. Integrated VOIP with both 3D positional voice and radio ensures full communication capabilities with no need for third-party software. Text chat and pre-recorded voice messages (commo rose-style) also available for the mic-less and the shy.Prefer single-player? Missions with friendly A.I. and a full command systemare fully planned.▶ BE IN FULL CONTROLIn the tactical shooter realm, movement and weapon handling are king. Take full control of your character with standing, crouching and (soon!) prone stances—each with multiple movement speeds—as well as unique weapon postures (including low- and high-ready), leaning and stepping out, free-look (head movement independent from aim), customizable and optional free-aim (dead zone), dedicated mouse sensitivity sliders for point-shooting/unmagnified/magnified aiming, and all-around highly configurable key bindings.You can also choose between speed reloads (drop magazine) and tactical reloads (retain current magazine) on the fly.▶ ADDITIONAL FEATURES(both working/in-process—marked √—and planned)MissionsGROUND BRANCH's unique \"campaign\" format will deliver smaller, more localized sets of missions based around global hotspots, with a centralized intelligence interface to monitor them and receive new mission orders over time. The choices you make along the way may affect future engagements.√ Based on unique environments all over the world, the non-linear mission and map designs offer multiple entry points and open-ended outcomes.√ Enemies are spawned at mission start, with a degree of randomization to quantity and location. No \"monster closets\" or magic enemy spawns based on player location or mission progress.Multiplayer√ Ready Room: A physical multiplayer lobby where you can plan your approach, see your teammates' loadouts, test weapon configurations on a firing range and jointly select insertion points.√ Full—and free—dedicated server support. Host a server wherever you want!Create your own unit patches and attach them to your character's sleeves and headgear.Full support for MP ladders.After-action review (AAR) following each mission/round.Server-side options.MiscellaneousFull mod support.√ No gear unlocks, hit markers, kill confirmations or score pop-ups.Weapon bracing/supporting.√ Varied arsenal: Multiple handguns, submachine guns, carbines, assault and battle rifles, machine guns, DMRs, sniper rifles and explosives to choose from, with selectable ammunition type (e.g. full metal jacket, hollow point or subsonic rounds, smoke grenade color etc.).√ Map variation: In addition to day and night versions as well as weather variation, maps have small details that can change between rounds, such as doors and windows that may be open, closed or blocked.√ Unlimited loadout save slots.√ Item sharing/dropping/pickups.√ Accurate ballistics with penetration, bullet drop and stopping power simulation.No regenerating health or health packs: Administer first aid to non-lethal injuries for reduced combat effectiveness. Location damage model: Expect visible injuries and consequences, such as limping, reduced arm function, and/or hits to stamina and accuracy. Players immobilized from a non-lethal injury can stay in the fight.Carry teammates to safety to administer first aid—or to safely recover their ammo, gear, cargo or body if they are no longer alive.Appropriate and realistic playable female characters.√ Partial controller support (configurable)."}

Snow and ice have shaped a merciless landscape. Nature is corrupted. Monstrous creatures out of an Eldritch horror dream roam the frozen wasteland.As the player you take the role of Ash, a natural but tormented leader. In that role you explore a post-apocalyptic, frozen wasteland to gather the resources necessary to establish a refuge for survival. With dwindling resources, simple tasks like upgrading equipment and collecting materials quickly require an expedition to scavenge the necessary items. In the search for survival materials, you must navigate a vast territory, in which you will encounter Eldritch monsters and an even greater foe: the unrelenting winter. While freezing temperatures constantly take their toll on Ash, the deadliest event is that of a blizzard. If caught by surprise, it takes every ounce of skill, determination and luck to survive. In order to survive and overcome all challenges, you need to attract followers, bringing them into your refuge. Each individual skillset and character traits grants access to higher tier resources and gear. Without followers, you can scavenge only the barest necessities, crafting only makeshift tools and weapons.  Fade to Silence introduces the many dynamics of a harsh winter climate to a complex, character-driven, group survival experience. The dynamic weather system adds to the immersion of survival in a cold, corrupted world. Survival depends on how well you read weather patterns, and if you come to the right conclusion: either to look for shelter or to press home. The dynamic snow displacement leaves a realistic path by both player character and NPC. This telltale sign will tell you regions where it is good to hunt and regions where monsters are roaming. Features:Tense atmosphere and unforgiving gameplay. This is a strategist’s game. An exploration mode lets you roam the world and experience the story at your own pace. Explore a vast winter landscape: The launch version lets you explore a river delta, a dense forest region and cultivated farmland of an 8km² area. Wolf Sled Expeditions: Pack your sled, take a follower with you and engage in long-term expeditions into the farthest regions. Recruit followers to get access to better gear, enabling you to survive the cold environment and increasingly dangerous creatures. Lead your followers and keep them alive. You will face harsh moral choices. Battle increasingly dangerous Eldritch creatures that roam an apocalyptic world. 2 player co-op gameplay (once the host player has recruited the first follower)Trust your inner voice.

You will build the airport’s infrastructure with everything from runways and taxiways, gates and aprons to constructing terminals with check-in, security, restaurants and shops. You will manage the business perspective of the airport by hiring employees and executives, making deals with airline companies and making sure that ends meet by keeping an eye on budget and resources. You will have to cater to the passengers by keeping waiting time to a minimum, by having friendly and helpful staff around and by making passengers feel secure, keeping any potential incidents at bay; a happy passenger is a spending passenger. Hopefully you won’t run into any problems such as stressed out employee, equipment breakdowns or bad weather which can cause massive delays or even emergency landings. You will be held accountable when things go wrong and filthy rich when things go right.Running an airportYour objective is to build and manage your airport to perfection by making strategic decisions, designing the optimal airport layout and ultimately making sure that your passengers and airlines are satisfied. You will need to build the entire airport from scratch including terminal foundations with floors, walls, doors and items as well as the airport infrastructure including runways, taxiways, aprons and other airport infrastructure. Everything in Airport CEO is deeply simulated and it is your job to make sure it all runs smoothly and with a positive bank account.AirlinesAirlines and their travelers are an essential element of Airport CEO as they consist of the main source of your airport’s income. Signing contracts with airlines bring cash-flow and passengers to your airport which in term means opportunities for receiving different service fees, as well as passenger expenditures. Airlines come in different sizes and have different requirements on your airport and the services you offer, you are responsible for not only planning the flight schedule but also for meeting and maintaining the needs. Occasionally you will need to handle emergencies and delays due to bad weather or accidents in the area, all which will put your management skills to the test.PassengersPassengers in Airport CEO all have their unique personalities, needs, a background story and most importantly; a flight to catch (on time). Passengers are thoroughly simulated and their decisions, behaviors and opinions about your airport are affected by several factors. Passengers in Airport CEO, just as in real life, must wait in lines, check in, pass security and then entertain themselves until their flight is ready for boarding. Arriving passengers must find their way the baggage claim, get a hold of their bags and maybe pass a customs booth before getting on their airport transfer. Whether they’ll be able to actually catch their flight is up to you: Passengers might have a hard time finding their way around the airport so you build an information desk, passengers might get irritated because of the long security queue and waiting time so you extend its capacity, passengers might complain about the lack of fun things to do in the gate area so you build a duty-free shop or exclusive brand boutiques.EmployeesEmployees are those you rely on to keep your airport running. Just as passengers they are simulated individuals who have a mind of their own. Employees have a number of different roles and it is your job to make sure that your airport has the right and necessary work force at any time. From passenger service agents, janitors, ramp agents and mechanics, security officers to administrators and executives. The more you expand your airport’s capacity and services, the more versatile and skilled your employees have to be. When employees interact with passengers, they’ll have to be skilled at managing people and stress resistant in order to avoid making mistakes or give bad customer service.Facilities and buildingsAirports are complex mega-structures with a lot of different buildings and facilities. While a small airport might not need more than a simple grass runway and a terminal, as you grow your airport you will have to expand its facilities ranging from air control towers, larger aircraft stands and taxiways to fire, weather, catering or fuel stations. As your airport grows your terminal grows with it and you will have to make sure that it is equipped with the necessary facilities that passengers are expecting. Building a terminal in Airport CEO is highly customizable where you lay out its shape and interior such floor type, walls, windows and doors. Baggage needs to be processed and transported to the same flight as its owner and its all up to you to avoid bottlenecks and by designing the ultimate airport terminal.Being a CEOData, data, data! As the acting CEO of your airport you need to be able to make difficult business decisions based on current operation. In Airport CEO you’re provided with multiple sources of information from which you can draw conclusions and manage your airport. As the CEO you will not only be responsible for the architecture of the airport but also for those working in it. Tired of planning every flight? Establish an informatics department and let an automated system do it for you! Tired of assessing the monthly budget balance? Hire a CFO which can help you cut cost and set prices. Best of luck!"}

Can you build the ultimate optimised, free-flowing car production line whilst beating the competition and still turn a profit?A modern car factory is a near perfect example of efficiency, process-management and flow. A massive army of precision-controlled robots dance to a milimeter-perfect ballet of engineering excellence with perfect timing. Components snake along conveyor belts to a 'just-in-time' ordering system that leaves no pauses, no delay, no confusion or congestion. Nothing exists but the perfect flowing efficiency of high tech car construction......in theory.In practice, of course, life is not so simple. When you get to grips with your first factory design, it certainly will not feel in a state of pure flow...or profit for that matter. Making a handful of built-to-order cars and breaking even is one thing...but competing with the big multinationals and churning out thousands of cars for the mass market is a whole new ballgame.To win market share from the big companies you are going to need planning, an appreciation of future technology, a careful eye on your bottom line, and an ability to design a factory layout that makes use of every square meter, and cuts production costs per car to the absolute minimum. Have you got what it takes to win? Production line is the new car factory management/simulation/tycoon game from Positech Games, the developers of Democracy &amp; Gratuitous Space Battles, and publishers of Big Pharma. This game is designed to appeal to the efficiency geek in all of us, the person who cannot help but organize things for maximum performance. The closet entrepreneur, the stats-geek,  Is that you? if so...welcome to your dream game (we hope!)The key to understanding production line is the division of labor and the merits of purpose-built machinery. At the start, your factory will be small and the individual slots on your production line will carry out large complex tasks (like fitting the car body). As you research better methods, and earn the funds to expand, you will continue to subdivide those slots into smaller (and faster) production areas which keep the flow of new vehicles flowing smoothly. At the same time, product design researchers will be working out how to enhance your cars with new technologies such as automatic headlights, power steering, bluetooth phone support and voice recognition. its a race to be productive AND a race to be profitable.

At the beginning, the player chooses freely a vehicle and drives it around town, enjoys the ultra-realistic feeling of driving and the original sounds and may even forget that the vehicle is virtual. Once gripped by the excitement of simulation driving, the standards increase: stick to tight schedules, carry special passengers, master the difficult traffic. But that’s not all. The ambition grows with the experience: Now the multiplayer is played under real conditions – the colleagues in the control centre coordinate by radio, the game leader set challenges in the middle of the road, unpredictable weather, real duty rosters and long shifts. And after all, how about recreating the way of the school bus and to master the student’s traffic this time on your own? Didn’t the mate from the historic vehicle society have an ancient tram car with crank control standing around? You could breathe life again into it in the simulator – as a museum run or maybe even at the time it originates…With LOTUS, dreams and ideas come true – and the best of it: every good realization will find followers and supporters that are hoping for extensions or are looking for exhausting the adventure of simulation driving. They are waiting for you!LOTUS, that means: L like Leitstelle, (German, control centre), O like omnibus, T like tram, U like underground, S like suburban train.FeaturesModular structure: Buy and play only what you are interested in – vehicles of the railway, like trams or trains, or vehicles of the road, like buses and trolleybuses, or even other modules that will be released later.Realism: Driving physics, environmental physics, graphical effects, sounds, weather, seasons and the world coordinate system are uncompromisingly realistic – that is our first priority.Multiplayer: Driving different tours with friends, greeting each other at the meeting point, ensure the connection by radio, coordinate everything in the control centre on your own or follow the instructions of your colleague – this and much more is provided by the multiplayer of LOTUS.Map editor: With many tools, aids and quite a few ingenious gimmicks mountains are moved, embankments planned, tracks laid and streets tarmacked. Afterwards the landscape is shaped and decorated with buildings, trees, lights, stops, benches, fences and much more.Content tool: Whether a single scenery object or a whole vehicle – with the content tool the objects are configured. From material settings to complex animation, from the design of the physics, the sound settings and the import and debugging of scripts, the content tool accompanies and supports the developer.Plugin interface: A discarded crank, the board information system with display, a driver’s desk or a whole cockpit can be operated with the simulator and get information back from it by the use of the plugin interface.*Schedules, passengers, traffic, multiplayer and weather will be enabled during Early Access and are not available from start!"}

Once you start to fulfill these orders you will have the opportunity to apply to unlock even more licences to expand your factory and make new and deadlier items. Eventually you will be granted a licence to manufacture armor, then ammunition, then firearms, explosives and the list goes on and on. This is not the only thing however. You will build up a reputation with your clients from around the globe. They may ask for certain items that might not be technically legal, or they may want to pay you in diamonds, cash or gold. If you choose to do business with such people that's up to you as an arms dealer. They will always offer you a very attractive price as they will be paying for anonymity.How will you transport the goods? Illegal arms usually travel in illegal ways and this is something you will have to consider depending on whom you chose to do business with. Gunsmith does not just stop at manufacturing, it continues on into the political sphere, providing you with the opportunity to manipulate global situations, push politicians into certain ways and cause conflicts on the basis of selling more arms to create even more profit. ( This is by no means inspired by anything that is currently happening in the world today ) It will be up to you as a Gunsmith to overcome all these challenges and ultimately saturate the market and make as much profit as possible. How you do this will be up to you."}

There once was a luring urban myth saying that if one can win the game would gain countless money as prize, and his/her destiny would instantly change to become the mightiest overnight. All the participants need only one stake——their souls. In the strange and lifeless scene, four gamblers are trying to run away from the devil, but there is no exit. All they can do is to perform a mystery sealing ritual to expel the devil and redeem their souls.A Tempting GambleNo one knows that this soul-gambling game is nothing but a hoax made by a ghost called Xi’E (from In Search of the Supernatural, Jin Dynasty). Ghost Xi’E is evil in its nature yet not powerful and unable to perform killing, yet it is a demon who wishes everyone to be evil. It uses the greed in people and lures them to the gamble to perform this cruel soul-gambling game after game.Ghost Xi’E uses its unique power to build dreams, turning the gambling game into a small illusion, luring the participants in it. For those who are inside this illusion, this gambling game is nothing but a real killing game. They will be hunted by devils during the escape, and Ghost Xi’E would conjure many cardholders to allow people to expel those devils who are also the poor souls that are imprisoned by Ghost Xi’E.Cheated by Ghost Xi’E, gamblers join the game one by one, which keeps the game alive. However, no one will actually win except for the Ghost.An Unfair CompetitionWithout exceptions, all the gamblers put their souls at stake. They are dragged into the illusion in groups of four. What they are facing is only one devil, who seems to be outnumbered, yet the gamblers are relatively weaker under the threats of the devil. All they can do is to collect cards, break the seal and expel the devil. However, the items that they redeemed from Ghost Xi’E only add small chances to survival.Ghost Xi’E’s tricks also haunt the devil so that it can never directly catch the preys in order to rouse the killing thirst inside them. The devil must wisely use its powerful pursuing ability to catch and execute the gamblers, or else become dust.Gamblers with Different DesiresEvery gambler who comes to this game is a living soul. They all come here with different purposes, some has lost their loved ones and money and wants to regain youth, beauty and their lives; some runs away from crimes and wants to make the final struggle here; some are innocent and naive, only to be tricked to come here; some come here for brothers, willing to sacrifice for others. However, no matter who they are and what their purposes are, in the eyes of Ghost Xi’E, they are nothing but souls and something to play with.The Cruel and Wronged DevilsGhost Xi’E gathered countless wronged spirits and transformed them into cruel devils. With the power of resentment, each devil possesses a unique and despairing power.Charming Oriental ScenesGhost Xi’E builds illusions one by one based on the real world so that they are too real for one to see the truth. A plagued abandoned train station where heavy bangs and cracking can be heard in the wind. A hundred years old palace that used to be so flourishing is now deserted, terrible sighing can be heard during midnight. A far away Hakka Tulou that was cursed due to a terrible ghost wedding has lost its peace. In these half real and half unreal scenes, gamblers have gradually forgotten the real world.The Stake-redeemed ItemsIn every gamble, the gamblers can obtain stakes via sealing the cardholders while the devil via catching and killing gamblers. This senseless stakes gave both parties the hopes to win and rouse their greed. The stakes can be redeemed for all kinds of surviving and hunting items from Ghost Xi’E. Beneath these hopes are nothing but the tricks of the demon who only wants to feed on people’s essence and energy.The Game of SoulsIn countless gambles, the gamblers and the devils continually explore and learn from each other. As a gambler, one must decide whether to focus on the cardholders or helping the injured teammates, or escape by items or depending only on themselves. As a devil, one must decide whether to hunting or waiting for gamblers to come to you, whether to chase or sneaking attack. Each encounter is a game, and every choice might endanger your soul. It is a game of souls after all, and the stake is your life.The Inflated DesiresIn order to entangle all the participants, Ghost Xi’E uses many ways to assist the growth of gamblers and devils. In order to win more gambles, the gamblers and the devils must constantly enhance themselves to discover more abilities so that they might live a little bit longer to meet another unknown gamble. This is for filling the bottomless greed, also simply for surviving."}

Featuring the talents of comedian, actor and musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by some of the biggest names in metal music it's a wild ride in the belly of the beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike. Included as a free bonus in the PC version of Brütal Legend are both the Hammer of Infinite Fate and Tears of the Hextadon multiplayer map packs.StoryThe vivid and wildly creative world of Brütal Legend is brought to life through a spate of chrome, leather, rocker babes, epic music, fire-breathing/stud-wearing beasts, mountains made of guitar amps, and more. Follow Eddie as he embarks on a tour of epic destruction with an axe, a guitar, and his minions as he commands the power of rock in epic band battles. It’s lighter-flicking awesomeness that will melt your face clean off.CombatBrütal Legend’s combat is a combination of classic action slasher and real time strategy mechanics.  Melee and ranged combat come from your double-sided broadaxe and demon-slaying, pyrotechnic-creating guitar.  Add that 1-2 punch to a guitar solo mechanic that can summon objects, buff your teammates, or cripple your opponents, and you have a deep, gratifying core gameplay combat loop that is fun for the hardcore and accessible for the casual.  On top of that, players will journey from Roadie to Rock God by commanding legions of metalheads into Brütal Victory and sending troops charging into battle.A Streaming Open WorldBrütal Legend gives you the freedom to walk, drive, or fly anywhere in a fully streaming open world whose art style is inspired by some of the most iconic and hilariously rad metal album covers ever created. Every vista in the beautiful universe of Brütal Legend looks like it was pulled from a Frank Frazetta painting.Packed With Cameos and Voice TalentBrütal Legend is full of cameos from gods of metal like Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, and many, many others. It has a MASSIVE metal soundtrack from every era of metal music: 1970’s classic metal to 1980’s hair metal to the scarier cousins of 1990’s metal. And of course, Jack Black pays the ultimate homage to metal as Eddie the Roadie, continuing the theme from the work of his band, Tenacious D and his previous films like School of Rock and High Fidelity.Multiplayer Mayhem4v4 \"skirmish\" multiplayer marries action combat with a strategic unit-control mechanic. As the leader of one of the factions in the game, the player will direct his armies in a Battle of the Bands where the trophy is survival. Brütal Legend’s multiplayer is online-enabled, so you can conquer your friends online (broadband connection required for online play).MusicThe music in Brütal Legend is truly massive. Made up of 108 of the most rocking tracks from 75 different bands representing every sub-genre of metal, it is something to experience in and of itself."}

The goal is to try to bridge the gap between the depth and complexity of traditional village simulators, the fun of godlikes and tower defense, with the simplicity of real-time strategy games.Build A Village, and Die Trying!A major part of the game is village management, and trying to discover new and creative ways to use the tools at your disposal to keep yourself alive as long as possible while you defend your village at night from the raging hoard of monsters, and try to expand in the day time. In this game, you will lose frequently, but with every failure you learn a little bit more about how to survive and apply that knowledge to your next attempt.Frequent 100% Free Content Patches!Like getting new content and not having to pay for it? Well, this is the game for you. For years Rise to Ruins had gotten frequent and completely free content patches, expanding the base game regularly!Several Game ModesSurvival is the game the way it was meant to be played, as a brutal survival style village sim, you will probably die often trying to figure out the best way to survive, but that's half the fun right?!Traditional is very similar to Survival, but it's balanced much like a traditional village simulator with some godlike and RTS elements sprinkled on top. The monster spawn rates are much lower, and the main focus is keeping your village happy and fed. It's a very easy mode, designed for casual players, or players just wanting to experiment.Nightmare makes survival mode look like it's for carebears. Mostly, it's just like survival mode, but difficulty levels are ramped up through the roof. This is the masochist's mode.Peaceful is the mode for you if you want to play a more laid back, classic village management game. There are no monsters what so ever, and no need to defend people. Just chill out and try to keep your villagers alive.Sandbox, like the name implies, is a mode where you can play around with the game mechanics. Change the time of day, weather, spawn monsters or villagers, or even edit the map while you're playing on it. This is the ultimate \"Screw around\" mode for players wanting to play with the game mechanics.Custom allows you to make up your own mode. You can adjust day length, how many days in a season, how many monsters spawn, and all sorts of other things. If you don't like the game's default settings, make your own up!.Godlike ElementsNot only can you manage your village, but you also have many godlike abilities at your disposal. You can alter the terrain, blast enemies from afar, pick up objects or creatures, heal your villagers, speed up resource growth and all sorts of other fun godly stuff. You're part of this world just as much as your villagers are.Tower Defense ElementsThis isn't a tower defense game, but you'll still be getting some tower defense vibes from it! Use classic tower defense mechanics to defend your village at night, creating walls of towers behind maze walls to help keep your little villagers alive as long as possible, and if tower defense isn't your thing. That's ok! You can also raise an army of golems and recruit guards to defend the village.World Maps and Regions!The game has tons of hand made maps for you to select from (You can also make your own if you like!) Every biome follows a certain theme (Forest, Desert, Drylands, etc). Start your village anywhere you like, and slowly conquer the whole world! (Well, try to anyway, you'll probably just die.)The Soundtrack!A full original soundtrack, made by Bibiki Garcia that blends orchestral instruments in a way fans of old 1990s era PC gaming will love and remember!SixtyGig Games is a DRM free independent game developer! Rise to Ruins will not now or ever in the future have any sort of DRM! Piracy protection only hurts you guys, the loyal paying players. So you rest assured knowing that once you buy yourself a copy of Rise to Ruins you'll never again have to concern yourself with nagging questions about if you can continue playing the game down the road due to something like always-online logins, lost registration codes or because you bought a new computer and you're only licensed to put the game on one. All I ask from you is to be reasonable and responsible, you can buy the game and play it as much as you like, wherever you like. Just tell your friends to support my DRM-Free philosophy and buy their own copy! Free Content Patches, no paid-DLCI don't believe in paying for Downloaded Content. If you buy Rise to Ruins you will have access to the entire game and all the content I'll ever create for it, forever! I believe DLC is greedy, and you deserve to have the full gaming experience from day 1, right out of the (figurative) box!"}

We developed a unique way to create dense forest floors which requires players to clear the land in order to build. Explore vast and diverse landscapes ranging from the cold mountainous peaks to the tropical seashores, and from the harsh deserts to the muggy swamplands. Built from the roots up using real-world photogrammetric data, experience next generation graphics in both variety and detail.Stockpiles and Shipping BinWe introduce a new concept in stockpiles. Heavy goods require physical space for storage, so while you can still store light goods in your small containers, wood, stone, ore, and other heavy materials must be stored in large stockpiles. This gives players a visual representation of their goods, and since stockpiles take up space, thought must also go into defending them. Each player also can craft a stash container which accepts a mix of light and heavy goods to help get them started, but these come with limited slots. Players may also build shipping bins. These can be placed in your base and you may sell harvested, crafted, and farmed goods in them for in-game currency. Shipping bins also come with a catalog with which you may order items using your hard earned in-game currency.Farming and CookingGet farm-ready with the hoe, watering can, sprinklers, and scythe. Each tool has its own set of tiers, and there are a variety of crops that may be planted. Fertilizers are also an important consideration for the aspiring farmer.Once your crops have matured, harvest them and bring them to the cooking stations in order to produce a wide range of food types. You may also decide to sell your crops in your shipping bin and buy more seed for your farming operation.Building &amp; CraftingConstruct your new home - From a quick hobo shack, a rustic cabin deep in the woods, a refined mansion, or a giant fortress. Craft and place walls, floors, doors, windows, furniture, and other fixtures individually by your own design. Process goods with sawmills, tanneries, smelters and other workstations. These materials will aid in crafting at various workstations and purchasing blueprints. Protect your establishment with well-placed cannons and strategically planned fortifications using massive rampart building sections.Mounts, Livestock &amp; WildlifeThe landscape is populated by a variety of American wildlife, all of which can be hunted - assuming you are not hunted yourself. But they can also be tamed, whether as livestock or as a beloved pet. You may ride tamed horses, as well as other animals - even bears!SurvivalGather and hunt for food to keep yourself strong. Collect a variety of raw materials from nature for use in crafting, building and refinement. Once you have the basics of sticks and stones down, you may begin your journey towards establishing yourself as an industrious and powerful colony or even President of the United States.There will be struggles and fallbacks along the way. Your character may be killed and robbed, where everything he or she has equipped is taken. Your property may be broken into and looted by a gang of raiders lead by other players. But with plenty of resources and defensive tactics at your disposal, raiders will be in for a serious fight.Go Forth and MultiplyStart a family with other players or NPCs. Players can give birth to a newborn. The newborn grows to become a baby, the baby then grows up to be a child, the child eventually becomes an adult.A second option is to adopt from an orphanage by purchasing a baby basket in the shipping catalog. The baby will be inside the basket delivered to you. Adoption is very expensive, but provides a guaranteed outcome. Your children are a mix of the visual DNA of the two parents. Babies, children, and adults will need to feed and stay hydrated. Once your kids become adults you can equip them with outfits, gear, and weapons. They can help protect you when you are online.Road BuildingBuild roads in the game or create pads around your base using the rake tool. Players may build roads using a variety of materials ranging from wood chips, dirt, sand, gravel, pavement and more. Players may also place freshly cut lawn for a well-kept look.Seats of PowerAs President, you own the Whitehouse, a section of land south of the monument, one intern, a golden gun, and two secret service NPCs. You also get to set and collect a President’s land tax. Players may also become the Sheriff, Chief, or Governor. Each are given their own areas, items, and NPCs. Combat &amp; CaptureOn your adventures you'll encounter other players who may or may not be friendly. Likewise, you may not be so friendly either given these tactics at your disposal:- Fill 'em full of lead with plenty of handguns, rifles, shotguns and other firearms to craft.- Take the more silent approach with bows and javelins that will leave your foes looking like a pin cushion.- Get up in their face with melee instruments, or beat them down with some good old blunt force.- Capture, restrain, and put them into your interrogation dungeon with its various contraptions.- Messily dismember with a well-placed strike or shotgun blast.- Blow them to smithereens with artillery cannon fire and TNT.- Experience the thrill of vigilante justice from either a first or third person perspective.Character CustomizationChoose your gender and tune your appearance to your liking, including variations in skin tone, height and girth, the shape of facial features, hair or lack thereof, and voice tone."}

Global warming caused the melting of the northern polar ice cap, tropical storms ravage all areas that didn’t suffer from desertification. Pockets of humans are crawling their lives away in a few slums, descendants of those who were left behind or refused to leave. Others created huge conurbations, based upon some of the most populous cities once on Earth. Most of humanity, though, has moved on the Moon, Mars, Titan, and other Jupiter’s moons. Earth is often used as a location for entertainment events like hi-speed races, futuristic amusement parks and zoo parks, which allows local communities to work and profit in a harsh environment.One of the most popular sports is the SRRL, or Solar Redout Racing League: the fastest racing league ever created, where humanity's best pilots drive high speed anti-gravity ships on magnetic tracks, risking their lives at each and every corner, in exchange for neverending glory."}

There are \"Close Ranged Attack\" and \"Long Ranged Attack\". Press either of the attack buttons repeatedly for auto combo!GuardBlocks against all normal attacks and takes no damage. However, players are unable to guard against Break Attacks.Break AttackA slow, wide-range heavy attack.

The attacker wins if they have the stronger hand or is even. If the attacker has the weaker hand, the defender wins."}

Astrox Imperium is a space based rpg that offers familiar game play in an open-world universe. With tons of ships, upgrades, and options, being lost in space might just be fun.", "price": 12.49, "sentiment": "Very Positive", "percent_positive": 87, "n_reviews": 190, "early_access": true, "about": "Astrox Imperium is my attempt to create the space game that I wanted to play, but no one had created. I wanted a single player, open-world space game that is similar to games I enjoyed, like Homeworld and EVE, with economies, factions, and a story. A game where I could set all the parameters, and the universe would come alive with new challenges each time I played. I tried to take the best of what I liked from many of my favorite space games, and combine them into something simple but deep, familiar yet fresh, and enjoyably addicting to play.The human struggle to survive is an all too familiar one. As the planet collapsed into an ecological depression, mankind as a whole is forced to expand his vision to the skies. A grand ship was built, and the ‘Imperium’ was scheduled to launch mankind into the future. With a new Quantum technology at its core, the Imperium was mankind’s greatest achievement. Putting aside all differences, the people of world came together. Under a common goal, the efforts of an entire generation came to fruition. The Imperium was ready to carry the dreams of us all, and with it, the hopes of finding a second chance.Not any one person knows the whole truth, but from what can be gathered, here is what we know. The Imperium was destroyed, and many of the human pioneers perished during the event. The survivors congregated together and began to build a temporary home from the wreckage of the ship itself. At first they waited for rescue, but it wasn’t long before the first ones accepted their fate.It has been 230 years now, and mankind has been quite busy out there in the stars. The story of the Imperium, passed down through the generations, have all but faded away completely.The main game play loops are fairly simple, and familiar. What makes Astrox Imperium unique, is the way that you can easily glide between the various loops to maintain a nice level of progression, without it feeling any more ‘grindy’ than you want it to. Sure, you can just mine rocks if you want, but Astrox Imperium provides you many different ways to progress your pilot.As with most space games of this genre, mining is a big mechanic of Astrox. It is the easiest way to earn credits, and most players are familiar with how it works. You can also complete contract missions. These are randomly generated missions that offer a variety of task and objectives to complete. Some of these contracts are combat missions that will involve raiders, pirates, and sometimes regular npcs. The combat missions offer a bit more action to an otherwise relaxed game. The rate at which you choose to progress is up to you. You are given a number of game options allowing you to adjust 'the grind' and speed of the game. There are a number of small, interesting little mechanics sprinkled throughout the game that were given a lot of thought and care, but you will not find anything groundbreaking or innovative here. This game is meant to feel comfortable and familiar. The game play loops are designed to be simple enough to understand quickly, and complex enough to enjoy over many hours of play.Many of the classic mechanics from the space game genre have been incorporated into Astrox Imperium. Basic interface controls were designed using elements from some RTS and FPS games. All the fan favorites and core game play elements have been included; mining, crafting, trading, refining, fleets, combat, exploration, survival, and more. This game will seem familiar to fans of the space survival / exploration game genre. Here is a list of features that are currently in the game.

There are things you can do AFK, but this game requires user input to play.Astrox is NOT multiplayer. I may add some co-op in the future, but Astrox will never be a MMORPG.Astrox does NOT have AAA quality models and textures. Many are placeholders and will be replaced.Astrox is NOT another vaporware EA project. The original Astrox launched on March 23rd 2014What to expect from me, the developer.I will listen to all feedback, and do my best to adjust the game to make it the best it can be.I will not leave for any extended period of time during the Early Access phase of the game.I will update the game frequently with bug fixes taking priority over new features and shiny do-dads.I will be extremely active, accessible, and available on our forums and discord channels.I will not ruin the game with in-game payments, subscriptions, or anything that requires additional payment.I will always be extremely thankful and grateful that you took some time out of your life to play Astrox.

It’s not just a sailing game, it’s a fully featured sailing simulation that should leave you with some understanding of how to pilot a real yacht once you master it.Once you have learnt the ropes you set out into the open waters surrounding the Shearwater Islands and seek out features such as the wreck of the Princess Zara. You can also take on challenges, such as sailing races, treasure hunts, passage planning and collision avoidance in obstacle courses.Use eSail to practise your skills before skippering or crewing a real world boat.  Or keep your sailing in the virtual world - it’s up to you!ACCURATE BOAT HANDLINGeSail is the ultimate choice for precise and realistic boat handling.  From the buoyancy to the steering “the thought processes and actions required to sail your virtual boat are remarkably close to the real world”  YACHTING MONTHLY. LEARN FROM THE EXPERTS eSail includes a complete sailing course which can support your certified training (RYA, US Sailing, Sail Canada etc.).  “Learn Yachting with eSail” has 20 interactive tutorials written by and narrated by experts such as Jon Dobbin (Ocean Yachtmaster) and Hannah White (the Guinness Book of Records holder for the fastest sailing dinghy crossing of the English Channel). The course covers everything from raising the sail through to using the chart, anchoring, mooring and more advanced sail trim. NOTE: You should never pilot a sailing vessel without proper certified training which eSail can support but in no way replaces.“eSail Sailing Simulator has raised the benchmark for comprehensive, fully detailed and exhaustively accurate sailing education. Simply put the tutorials included here are brilliant!” SIM UK.GO EXPLORE WITH LIVE SAILINGWith Live Sailing mode you explore the seas and ocean around the Shearwater islands while experiencing constantly changing weather patterns, from gentle breezes to the fiercest of storms. Before you weigh anchor listen to the forecasts on your VHF radio and set your sails accordingly (or reef them!).  Your current position and boat set up is always saved so you can return to the same point and continue your journey. While live sailing you can collect ‘Points of Interest’ (POIs) and ultimately achieve ‘Master Explorer’ status if you visit them all!CHALLENGE YOUR SAILING SKILLSeSail includes numerous challenges: eSail Races. Pit your skills against ‘computer skippered’ boats and become skilled at race tactics, tacking, gybing and trimming the sails including using the mainsheet, jib sheets and kicker (boom vang). Treasure hunts. It’s all about throttle control! You need to get close enough to click on your prize without drifting into the jetty or quay. And make sure you are not going too fast when you grab your treasure or it will end up smashed on the deck!Steering Challenges. Steer between the red and green buoys and keep your speed up for maximum points.   But be careful of the other boats.  They should observe collision regulations or ‘Rules of the Road’ but with your boat constantly changing direction they do not always behave as expected!Anchoring. In these challenges you will anchor up, then we check your swing circle by applying different wind directions. You need to take into account the condition of the sea bed and lay down enough anchor chain.Passage Planning. Using our unique charting tool, create a course between locations such as Maxwell Marina and Frazer Town via given waypoints. At the end of your voyage make sure you moor up safely (using your fenders) without making contact with the jetty!“If you’re new to sailing this is a fantastic way to learn at home and brush up skills. If you’re an experienced sailor then it’s still great fun and adventures can be had navigating around using charts or sailing through challengingly tight spaces!” PRACTICAL BOAT OWNERRacing through the canals in Little VeniceFEATURESSailing controls. Use your virtual crew to take full control of sails, control lines, winches and travellers. Practise your winch technique and learn how to operate cleats and jammers safely.  You can also use AutoSail mode to make things a little easier when you are starting!Anchoring.  Think about the weather and check the conditions of the sea bed - sand, weed or rocks? - before deciding how much chain to let out.  Get it wrong and your anchor will drag!Mooring. Decide your best approach to the quay, step off the boat and secure your mooring lines. You can then opt to set up spring lines and even slip lines to help depart your mooring without embarrassment!Charting. To the best of our knowledge eSail is the only simulator with a charting module which represents paper based charts. Use tools like dividers, plotter and pencil to plot your course, while looking out for lights from buoys and lighthouses to check your position. The World of Shearwater.  In our virtual world there are numerous places to visit within easy reach. Set in the mid Atlantic, the Shearwater Islands have been formed by volcanic activity and have changed hands many times. The Spanish, British, Americans and Italians have all left their mark – the latter building the folly known as Little Venice. This town has many buildings virtually identical to those found in the real Venice. The builders have thoughtfully created canals large enough to sail along with few bridges, so you can motor, sail and even race along the watery streets!Weather. eSail models areas of high and low pressure which then move across the islands creating an infinite variety of wind and waves patterns. The wind and waves are further modified by the land masses, creating areas of calm where you can find shelter from the worst storms and anchor safely!"}

It focuses on the logical reasoning of the criminal investigation which includes details like the motive for murder, method, and creation of an alibi. Better yet, a comprehensive and powerful editor of cases will be provided. With the editor’s help, you can effortlessly follow the footsteps of Detective Conan, or become the next Sherlock Holmes, to uncover the great unsolved mysteries!You will choose the murder weapon to kill the victim and remove all the traces.You will choose when and where to act and use optical illusion of other characters to create a perfect alibi.You should consider how to use the different tool marks to confuse the police and forensic experts.You can try to pin the murder on other characters by leaving someone's house keys at the scene of the crime, committing the crime in someone’s house, and so on.Children are not allowed to play the game.Rules of playThe game is composed of two processes: crime and investigation.During the crime section, players should plan, create an alibi, choose the best method, process the crime weapon, and destroy evidence at the scene of the crime to avoid the suspicion of murder. Of course, players should also be careful about the specific time of every character's action, which could help them make a rigorous plan.During the investigation section, the police will find more details about the suspects according to their suspicious degree. They will investigate if the suspects have an alibi and places where they regularly visit. Every aspect will influence the suspicious degree. For example, if you don’t have an alibi, then the suspicious degree of you will rise rapidly. But if the murder is done properly by the player, then the police will not find the truth and the murderer will escape. Thus, a perfect crime is made.DetailsAction:Players will leave traces if they call someone, go to someone’s house, or touch something. Even if they choke someone to death, there will be scratches on their arms because the victim’s struggle. All these traces are important evidence when the police are solving a case.Tools:Players will meet lots of tools in the games, such as keys, cups, daggers, etc. Each tool has its own functions, but these tools cannot be used casually. For example, there are only two persons in the room, the tool and yourself. If you directly take up the knife on the table, the other person will be suspicious and ask you to put it down. But he will not see it if you can shift his focus when you take up the knife.Psychological pressures:Players will have psychological pressure when they are deciding dangerous options. For example, choking someone to death or tying someone up are considered dangerous. If the psychological pressure is too high, then players will not be able to carry out the action. So, players should allocate their psychological pressures reasonably by using some skills.NPC:You will meet a lot of people in the game. They have different personalities and will react distinctively to the same thing. If they see a body in the room, some people will call the police immediately while some curious people will come into the room and check the body, leaving his traces.Alibi:An alibi depends on witnesses in the game. For example, Role A saw you walk into the restaurant at 8 o’clock and leave at 9 o’clock, then he can prove that you were in the restaurant from 8 to 9. If the time of death is 8:30 and it happened in the victim’s house, then you will have an alibi.Players always act as murders in cases, so all the alibis are fake. There are many ways to create an alibi and players are asked to find these ways by themselves. Your suspicious degree will be much lower if you have an alibi, which will contribute to your success.More details will be added to the game:The details make the game more challenging, but players enjoy the game more at the same time, because there are more methods to choose and the game is more realistic.EditorIf you are a big fan of Sherlock Holmes or other detective novels, would you want to create a major case by yourself?An editor is provided in the game, which can be used by players to create a case of their own. A few persons’ ability is limited, but we want to give players more freedom as much as possible. So, players are needed to join in.An access is provided in the game, which can be utilized for players to play the cases created by themselves. Players can upload their cases to Steam Work and release their MOD.We always have tremendous faith in the power of players."}

Search the Steam Store.What makes Trainz so special?Trainz: A New Era is far more than a train simulator. Sure there are hundreds of locos and dozens of routes and sessions you can drive in the Platinum Edition Bundle. But the real power of Trainz comes with all the extra things you can do beyond the builtin-in content set.All the tools to build your own railroad are included, and in fact, every route you see in Trainz is created by customers just like you. There are now well over 10,000 routes available on the Trainz Download Station (DLS) that you can download for free and enjoy. So when people tell you \"you have to buy lots of DLC\" remind them that the choice is theirs, with plenty of high quality free routes and content available on the DLS.Key FeaturesAll-new graphics engine with full world shadows and per-pixel lightingMultiplayer Share your enthusiasm with other rail fans and combine your efforts with others to operate a working rail line!Our most accurate simulation yet with real time world physics and editing tools!Our physics use a variety of configurable inputs such as engine powers, train weight and rolling resistance whilst taking into account factors like track gradient, curve resistance and track adhesion for each train car when accelerating or decelerating. The brand new real time physics editing tools allow players to tune physics 'on-the-fly' to take their simulation's performance even further.Brand-new Real-time Physics Editing tools enable users to enter known specifications to accurately monitor all the forces at work. Things like tractive effort, drawbar pull or brake pipe pressure can be monitored at a specific point along the train and input values adjusted \"on-the-fly\". By analysing and tuning performance without leaving the simulation, real-world train characteristics can be matched perfectly. (It's a bit like running a virtual dynamometer car).If physics aren't your thing, don't worry. You can leave the fine-tuning of your favourite locomotive's performance to the experts whilst still having the choice between 'Realistic Mode' or 'Easy Mode' driving options.Procedurally animated spline junctionsAn updated set of track laying tools are provided in Surveyor to automatically adds frogs/vee, blades, and checkrails in the correct place on the tracks when making a switch, turnout or junction. The blades then animate as the junction direction is changed.Realistic cab sway and external train motionUsing a new suspension modelling system and additional track and traincar parameters, cab sway and \"car rocking\" from both internal and external perspective provide more realistic train motion visuals. When running on rough track, cars will wobble and shake independently.Smoke and weather affected by world objectsNew particle effects and collision systems will prevent rain penetrating a tunnel, smoke will billow out from the underside of a bridge or the top of a tunnel and all particle effects will change velocity, direction and flow more naturally.Tons of Extra ContentAccess to over 250,000+ free DLC items via The Download StationIn-game downloadable content system for both payware and freeware optionsCreate your own routes with powerful in-game level editing toolsConfigurable control schemesNever lose your way with the in-game navigation systemOpen multiple windows to view and compare items in Preview Mode while creating your world in another windowIncl. 250 page digital user manual - a digital PDF providing detailed information on every aspect of TrainzStandard Edition Routes and SessionsTrainz: A New Era provides a variety of high quality routes - built-in to the core edition, available as Downloadable Content (payware) or from the DLS (freeware).

If you'd rather get going immediately you can always browse the workshop for ships that other players made, or you can upload your own blueprints.The galaxy can be a dangerous place, even when playing solo. Strange rifts have opened up, unleashing a hostile race of alien creatures called the Skrill. If left unchecked, they will take over solar systems wreaking havoc on your enterprising. You can fight them alone, or call in the help of your friends, and man a ship together. But not all pilots will fight for a good cause, pirates and opposing fleets can come after you and your cargo at any time. Fight them ship versus ship, or hack your way aboard their vessels and bring the fight to them, in close quarters shootouts. The economy of Interstellar Rift runs on the resources that can be gathered out in the galaxy. Vast asteroid belts circle planets and solar systems, filled with precious ores and minerals. Start up your resource extractors, or send out a wave of mining drones to do the hard labour for you. Visit the stores of LogiCorp and Galactic Trade, or drive a hard bargain with stranded pilots as you delive them fuel. Automate production lines with the ACTR (automated cargo transfer relay), and set up your own store to trade with other players, or any trade drones that might be nearby. After choosing a faction to ally with, the galaxy is open for you to explore. Use rift generators to open up spatial rifts that transport you to new systems, exploring a system will help you map out the galaxy, and pinpoint the location of systems with special resources you might need. Construct new trade posts for the companies and factions that want to expand their influence, and help them set up secure stations and sectors. Take on missions for U-nits, or find good deals across multiple systems to make a profit from."}

We got so used to it that news from Syria has become trivial. We've even already forgotten how it all started, and where the roots of the terrible terror lie – the terror that swept across Europe in recent years.Syria is all over the news, and it's become a subject of many documentaries. We, however, want to show the story through the lens of the game and don't let the word \"game\" mislead you. This game does not claim to be a history lesson, but it shows the course of the war in all its seriousness through the major milestones, from the first days till the latest important victories over terror.What kind of a game is it?Syrian Warfare is a real time strategy with a high degree of realism. This game is not about a base construction or units production. The player will have to determine their forces characteristics before they go into action. And during the mission, they would be able to select reinforcements in order to support the troopers.The troops and machinery crews move from mission to mission and gain experience, which helps them increase their effectiveness.Trophies captured by the player on the battlefield can be used throughout the whole campaign.Importantly enough, there are no «life bars» for vehicles in the game. Damages are calculated by taking into account the protection module and the power of adverse factors. Inflicted damages affect the functioning of the module.In the battlefield, it is impossible to repair the armor, but one can repair the modules by using a limited stock of spare parts. Ammunition and fuel are also limited.A system of high-quality physical demolition of buildings and other objects is used in the game (it does not only look spectacular, but it has a serious influence on the tactics during the missions, especially in urban areas).The game has a wide set of tactical possibilities: The storming of buildings, usage of smokescreens, infantry lift by helicopters and APC/IFV, air strike calls, capturing of trophy weapons and equipment, usage of heat flares and active defense complexes.And of course the story itself. We will try to show the conflict, not from a point of view of a general, located somewhere at the ‘top’. No, it will be a story of a man, who lived in the country that descended into hell. A story of struggle, loss and regained hope."}

The game drops players, as duos or lone wolves, into the oppressive environments of a radiation-ravaged Chernobyl spread across a section of the 25km2 map.To secure the top spot, players will need to worry about more than just other survivors. Across the hostile wastes, everyone is threatened by deadly anomalies and the dynamically-changing weather – voted for by players and spectators, both in-game and on streaming platforms. As time wares on and day turns to dusk, survivors must stay on their toes and constantly adapting to new situations.Protective gear allows players to explore dangerous off-limit radioactive zones inaccessible to less-equipped opponents - but filled with powerful loot. All the while, the howls of mutated creatures echo through the wasteland. Wolves and much worse lay in wait for foolish players who don’t keep their wits about them.Further breaking the mold of the genre, every game is made truly unique by the irregular and unpredictable spread of deadly radiation, which organically closes in on players with different stages of toxicity, all of which can be battled and avoided in different ways. Safety is rarely certain, and adept players will need to read the environment to determine when it is no longer wise to remain in an area.Finally, every match ends with a dramatic race to the extraction helicopter, with only one of the handful of survivors able to make it. Will you pick off stragglers from a rooftop until you are the only one alive? Or would you rather make a mad dash for freedom, leaving your pursuers behind and escaping under the cover of night? Each extraction is unique, with the final area layout and your skills deciding the winner. Cosmetic customization options and a deep progression system reward you for your victories and close-calls.All this, rival players, tight shooting mechanics, and an arsenal of guns, attachments, armour, and melee weapons mean no two matches are the same.Brutal FPS battle royale in the irradiated remains of Chernobyl20+ weapons with dozens of attachments, across a wide variety of effective ranges and situations, including meleeRadiation spreads dynamically from area to area, and can be survived with the right gearPvE elements keep each match different, with wolves, mutants, and other hazards a constant danger Finish matches in style with the final battle around the extraction helicopterArtifacts found in the wasteland change your gameplay experience significantly"}

Need for Speed SHIFT takes players in a different direction to create a simulation experience that replicates the true feeling of driving high-end performance cars.Players are thrust into the loud, visceral, intense, athletic experience of racing a car on the edge of control from the driver’s perspective through the combination of perception based G-forces, the hyper reality of the cockpit view, and the brutal experience of a first person crash dynamic. Need for Speed SHIFT features an accurate, accessible physics-based driving model that allows you to feel every impact, every change of track surface and every last bit of grip as you push yourself to the edge.True Driver's Experience - A variety of visual cues delivers the true driver’s experience including a three-dimensional HUD that mimics driver head movement, inertia and G-forces. The depth of field also adjusts based on the speed of the car; so when the car is traveling at high speeds the perspective will shift to the distance putting the car/cockpit out of focus.Driver Profile - What kind of driver are you? Driver profile tracks the player’s evolution as a race driver from event to event. This system is made up of a driver’s personality on the track, their success rate and any profile points and badges accrued all of which work together to create a tailor-made career and game play experience. Driver profile is pervasive throughout all modes: career and online.Dynamic Crash Effect - When the player hits a static object or opponent car, the player will feel like they are 'taking damage'. A combination of visual and audio effects will leave the player disoriented and briefly disrupt the race.Total Customization - Need for Speed SHIFT features a comprehensive customization option that lets the player tailor every aspect of the cars performance and styling. Go under the hood to upgrade and tune your vehicle to increase its performance. The visual customization system allows players to personalize both the exterior and trick out the interior to reflect their individual style and preferences.Photo-Realistic Cars and Tracks - Nearly 70 licensed cars are available including the Pagani Zonda F, Audi RS4, and Porsche 911 GT3 RSR. There is also over 15 real-world locations like Willow Springs and Laguna Seca as well as fictional circuits like downtown London and Tokyo."}

Ten game modes - both team-based and \"every man for himself\" -- provide even the most hardcore gamer with palm-sweating challenges through unbelievably detailed indoor arenas and vast outdoor environments. As the ultimate techno-gladiator of the future, players will take their fates into their hands, battling against up to 32 other players online in action-packed, frag-filled arenas.Assault Mode - Assault mode returns! Redesigned for UT2004, this fan-favorite mode sees teams face-off to defend and attack fortified bases, from fast-moving trains, barreling across an arid alien desert to a Skaarj mother ship, poised to attack the human home world. Onslaught Mode - Onslaught mode takes team combat to the next level! Opposing teams are pitted against each other to capture and hold strategic points in order to attack and destroy the enemy power core. Taking place in massive outdoor environments, here is where vehicular combat comes into its own. Flying and driving machines take combatants to the frontline and gigantic mobile battle stations serve as a platform from which to launch devastating attacks. Vehicles - Rev-up and ride out in an array of land-, air-, and space-based vehicles that play critical roles in a successful combat strategy in Assault and Onslaught. With vehicles ranging from single man fighters to five man behemoths, Unreal Tournament 2004 provides players with plenty of choices when shopping for a mechanized implement of destruction. Levels - More than 95 maps will be available immediately, including more than 45 brand new maps for all existing game play modes as well as new modes of play. Vast outdoor environments, deep space combat areas and tightly packed indoor techno-arenas are all waiting for the latest entrants to the Tournament. Weapons - The entire smorgasbord of frag-dealing weaponry from Unreal Tournament 2003 returns for the experienced player to wield masterfully against new contestants. Those armaments are joined by three new implements of doom: the Mine layer, which disperses spider-like bombs that chase and harass any enemy that comes within range; the anti vehicle rocket launcher, or AVRiL, which deals out a payload of massive rockets tuned to seek and destroy enemy mechanized units; the Grenade Launcher, which launches timed explosives that will bounce on the ground and stick to enemies and enemy vehicles, only to be triggered by the weapons altfire command; and, the return of the notorious Sniper Rifle from the original Unreal tournament, completely redesigned and upgraded to make heads roll. New Characters - Unreal Tournament 2004 introduces 32 new characters on four new teams: The human Thunder Crash, lead by Tournament hero, Malcolm; the Robotic Corrupt, lead by an upgraded Xan Kriegor; the Iron Skull, a team of merciless Skaarj warriors; and the Hellions -- wreckless human mercenaries and pirates who delight in the thrill of the kill. New Technology - Unreal Tournament not only brings new content for hardcore fans to relish, it also delivers a tremendous technology update over its predecessor, delivering a faster, slicker, deeper experience than ever before."}

This tech demo will allow players to drive all of the vehicles that we have currently completed and will be updated with more vehicles and features every week. You may also have up to 32 of your friends join you online with our new Multiplayer feature. The tech demo also gives players the chance to experiment with some core mechanics of the game and report bugs or feedback to be fixed and modified in daily patches.*Planned for full release*In EmergeNYC players will be thrown into a large dynamic and open-world which is based on a fictional New York City. Players will be able to take the role of a single member of a unit and possess the ability to switch to other units and personnel, command fellow AI firefighters and police officers, or join an online session and work with up to 32 players to protect the city and keep it running. EmergeNYC goes into depth when it comes to Emergency Simulation Games and aims to go where no other games in the genre have imagined. When starting EmergeNYC, you will be able to pick between Single Player Free Play and Co-Operative Multiplayer Free Play. In Single Player mode, you will have the ability to mesh how you want to play. If you prefer to have more control over things, you can play in Dispatcher/IC Mode, dispatching units to emergencies, and commanding units from above in an RTS and Emergency 4 inspired fashion.If you want to be more personal and interactive, Direct Control Mode is the way to go. When you switch to Direct Control, you will be able to take control of a single member of any unit whether it be an FDNY company, 2 NYPD Officers on a patrol, or EMS Partners awaiting a medical emergency. This mode functions as an advanced Third/First Person Simulation with a camera and character controller similar to Grand Theft Auto and other Open-World, Adventure, and Simulation games. EmergeNYC features realistic driving mechanics which accurately recreate the handling of different fire apparatus, police vehicles, and ambulances. Players will have the ability to switch between 3rd Person and 1st Person Cockpit cameras as well as have full control over their vehicles, including lights and sirens. In EmergeNYC, we have managed to create an advanced and stunning lighting system allowing the player to switch between different lighting patterns in a variety of different light bars and lighting setups. We have also given players full control of the siren(s) of their vehicle with the ability to wind up and down manual sirens seamlessly, honk the airhorns and switch between automatic siren modes. Traffic and pedestrians respond differently with how you use your sirens and horns. Third Person Gameplay update coming next week!In EmergeNYC's new major Third Person Update a bunch of new things will be added. Choose one of many roles throughout each fire company and the main precinct in the city. Customize your character's appearance &amp; change to up to half a dozen different uniform options and over a dozen different firefighter and police officer models.Hop in and out of your vehicle whether you're driving or just a passenger.Even split driving Tiller Ladder 75 in MultiplayerThird Person will seamlessly mix in with our current Multiplayer gameplay style, and you are able to spawn a character and customize them to your liking, all while it being extremely simple to leave your character, and switch back to driving other units on the map much easier. FireFighters will be able to equip almost 2 dozen different types of equipment and tools which aid in whatever situation is facing them. Force doors open with a halligan, an axe, or a hydraulic rabbit tool, its your choice. Cut open a roll down door blocking access to a fire with a K12 Saw, get up to a window, scaffolding, roof top, or fire escape with different sized extension ladders. Knock down fires with different sized hoses, each one more difficult to maneuver through buildings and aim than the other. As a fireman you will also be able to rescue people, perform basic medical procedures to stabilize a victim, extricate people from vehicles, and more. Gameplay as a firefighter is primarily 3rd Person, however when applying your SCBA Air Pack and Face Mask before entering a burning building, you will be forcefully put into First Person Mode. This is done to try and simulate the visibility, sounds, and what it is like to be inside of a fire. Police Officers have much different but just as interactive and exciting gameplay. EmergeNYC aims to take the stereotypical police game out of the equation and focus more on what police officers in New York City face each day while also throwing the player into intense and risky situations. Lethal force is rarely necessary and this is a police game that tries to not glorify weapons, or constant shootings. In EmergeNYC, police officers will be negotiating with armed suspects, suicidal peeps, chasing down robbery suspects on foot, and if necessary as a last resort, using lethal force. However, gameplay as a police officer is not always like the movies. Players will still be performing traffic stops, writing tickets to double parked vehicles, directing traffic at emergency scenes, and performing crowd control. As an EMT/Paramedic in EmergeNYC, you will be experiencing the most in depth treatment and medical procedure system in any game. Players will be able to perform real life treatments, administer medications, perform life saving techniques and monitor a patient's vital signs with the one goal of keeping them alive at an emergency scene and en-route to the hospital. From minor medical emergencies such as a diabetic suffering from hypoglycemia, to a catastrophic trauma like a civilian hit by a bus, or even pinned under a subway train. Gameplay will have the ability to be handicapped for players with no medical experience to have room for mistakes and learn basic medical procedures and treatments for different types of illnesses and injuries.In EmergeNYC, players will be able to join up to 32 friends on private or open user created servers with customization settings. Players will be able to work together, ride together and handle emergencies together. With an Arma inspired server lobby, once a player joins a server, any open position in a fire company, police patrol, or ambulance is able to be filled by a player. One player will have the ability to play as the dispatcher with an RTS view of the city and notify which units to respond to emergencies when they arise. With an established rank system, players who have filled sergeant, lieutenant, captain, or chief positions will have a variety of commands available to give to AI or fellow players. EmergeNYC is based in a fictional open-world recreation of Manhattan with an advanced traffic and pedestrian system.When completed, this open world will contain dozens and dozens of buildings and areas to explore, ranging from stores, residential buildings, parking garages, high-rises with rooftops, subway stations and tunnels and interiors to house a wide variety of emergencies. It will also be beautifully detailed and features a dynamic weather/day &amp; night system. EmergeNYC does not only go into detail and give players many options on the scene of an emergency, but also when not responding to a call and when en route to an emergency. Players will be able to interact with different environments when not occupied. Firefighters will be spread out across 5 unique firehouses with full interiors and 3 Engine Companies, 3 Ladder Companies,  A Squad Company, Rescue Company, and Battalion Chief ready to respond whenever and wherever needed. Police Officers will have a central fictional 14th precinct where players are able to choose and customize police vehicles, equipment, weapons, and their character. EMS workers will have a hospital emergency room to drop off patients, and resupply after a call."}

There are others, but will they help, or will they throw you to the void without a second thought? Remember, no matter how brutal space may seem, it cannot hold a candle to man.Hellion is a solar system several thousand lightyears from Earth. Despite its distance, it is the target of the first interstellar colonization mission during the 23rd century. Almost a million colonists, suspended in cryogenic hibernation, leave Sol on a journey that would take many decades.However, when they wake up, almost a century later, they find themselves trapped inside a nightmare. Instead of living in a manmade paradise, they are forced to fight for survival surrounded by deserted stations, incomplete orbital habitats and derelict warships.With the closest rescue operation decades away, orbital economy in disarray and no authorities in sight, many turn to scavenging, stealing and outright violence. Few others try to live more civilized and begin uncovering the truth behind the largest disaster in human history.Hellion is an ambitious project. It is an immersive world set in a solar system many lightyears from the comforts of Earth and is entirely based on the laws of Newtonian physics. Hellion will make its debut as an Early Access game. EA version represents the basics of the vision behind this dark world. As our community grows and the player base expands, the game will evolve beyond these confines and become a true space survival that we can all enjoy. Open and honest communication between developers and community is the cornerstone of this idea. We are always open for discussion with our players as we believe that each and every one of us can add something to this project. Join us in the dystopian future that is Hellion and let’s build this world together! Below is a comprehensive list of features planned for Hellion’s early access.

Your main source of victims will come from the brave and highly flammable ranks of the Glorious Empire, a sinister regime that gained power after the fall of the previous Overlord.

What can my minions do? Minions are angry little Swiss army knives of pain: They can ride into battle on wolves and other magical creatures, loot the best weapons from stomped enemies, pillage houses for treasure, operate fearsome war machines, infiltrate enemy camps and polish your armour so thoroughly you'll blind passing wildlife.                    What types of Minions can I rule? This new batch of minions is smarter, faster, deadlier and wittier than the sorry sacks of skin you used to rule. Minions now come in four fantastic flavours: Browns are brutal brawlers that solve their problems with teeth and fists. Reds are the surly artillery who love to play catch, as long as it's with fireballs. Greens are the stealthy assassins. Silent and deadly, like a fart on legs. Blues are no use in a fight but can resurrect fellow Minions who've tried to stop a sword with their face."}

You will need to do all of these to succeed, but how and when is your choice.Trade:Vendors and traders are scarce but provide valuable items including rare animals for those with coin. Items that they offer for sale can usually be collected and crafted, but do you have the time? Maybe you are missing that one ingredient for a must-have item. They probably have it, for a price."}

It is an essential part of the plot, and - especially later in the game - an element tightly integrated into the gameplay.You can \"die\" in this game! - It's an adventure game, so explore, solve puzzles... but beware. There won't always have the comfort of infinite time to solve a problem, sometimes you may have to think fast! Other times you may want to think twice before choosing a new course of action, as a wrong decision may cost you your freedom... or worse!The world of TSIOQUE is inhabited by creatures of all sorts - humans, animals, monsters, you name it. Don't let appearances deceive you, some seemingly nice people may not necessarily have the best intentions, and a seemingly terrifying monster may not be all that evil. Fortunately, even when events turn for the worst, Tsioque can always count on help from her friends, which she will find in least expected places.The main inspiration is inarguably LIFE, which always writes the best scritps. But of course we're not living in cultural vaccuum. While creating TSIOQUE, we couldn't help but be inspired by things that thrilled, shocked and amazed us in the past, that burned forever into our memory in the childhood days spent in front of the pale light of CRT monitors. Among many other inspirations, we could certainly count: a smart, humorous story backed by beautiful art style of DAY OF THE TENTACLE, simplicity of the gameplay and a serious approach to a younger player in games by Ron Gilbert like PAJAMA SAM, a vivid, dangerous world seen through the eyes of a boy in HEART OF DARKNESS, wonderfully animated epic fantasy and its gruesome punishments for failures in DRAGON'S LAIR, or INDIANA JONES AND THE FATE OF ATLANTIS, an old Lucasarts classic with a perfect blend of adventure, humor and action, where carelessness could cost you dearly."}

As the undisputed 1999 Game of the Year, Unreal Tournament grabbed the first person shooter genre by the soiled seat of its pants and knocked it around the room with its never-before-seen graphics, brutal edge-of-your-seat gameplay and a massive and varied feature list that gave gamers more than they ever expected.Novice Mode - This Botmatch competition is where new flak fodder hit boot camp. The Novice setting makes the computer controlled Bots in the game move slower and inflict less damage with their attacks. For those new to first person shooters, this is where teeth are cut, skills are born and addiction begins... Hardcore Mode - Strap on extra armor and have a hand towel next to your mouse pad to wipe away the palm sweat. This mode is only for the pros -- all of the bots move like lightning -- dodging, jumping and inflicting A LOT more damage with their standard attacks than do their Novice counterparts. Enhanced Bot AI - Bots in Unreal Tournament play as if they're jacked up on a big old shot of steroids. Their basic deathmatching skills have been virtually perfected, their understanding of the game rules is professorial, their ability to navigate levels is GPS-like, and their threat to your existence is very real. Radio Chatter - Each of the commands at your disposal in the game is accompanied by both a text message on screen AND an audio message. Pleas for back-up or for cover fire are accompanied by pre-recorded sequences communicating your needs. Making this especially cool is the fact that you can hear your opponents' messages too (even if you're playing against bots 'cause bots are people, too). New Command Line Options - For the hardcore server masters, this is the dream way to access features and manage a game. Virtually any option you want to tweak can be accessed via the UT command line. Nice and easy! Improved User Interface - Unreal Tournament introduced a better way to see what is happening during a game. By using a unique heads up display (HUD) for each game type (Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Domination, and Assault), the game provides ALL the info needed to play effectively WITHOUT bombarding the player with excessive info. UBrowser - Unreal Tournament's robust Ubrowser system provides the easiest way to find a game on the Internet and jump into battle. The Ubrowser eliminates the need to download third-party server querying applications. It's as simple as one-two-frag. By clicking on the \"Play Online\" button and then selecting a server from the list, the game is on. Spectator Cams - Watching a game of Unreal Tournament has the potential to be almost as much fun as playing it. Thanks to the Spectator Cams, gamers can enter a game and hop around to designated Spectator Cams to view the action on the level. Even cooler, the camera can be \"attached\" to one of the players in the level to view the action from their perspective. Either way, it's a cool feature and a great way to learn for people new to the world of online gaming. Jump Mode - Jump twice as high as normal. It's sorta' like having a never-ending pair of jumpboots on. The impact these boots have on gameplay is almost indescribable. It changes the dynamic completely.© 2000, Epic Games, Inc.

A vast land awaits your settlers and is ready to be colonized. Send your architects and builders to plan and construct a city. But also send your craftsmen, to cut some wood and to mine ore.

Townsmen – A Kingdom Rebuilt hands the crown to you: Guide your people from their first steps in a small village to a massive medieval metropolis with thousands of inhabitants. Overcome the challenges that lie ahead. Your citizens have various needs in order to stay happy. And you have to keep them happy, to keep the tax coins rolling which you need to build even more. Beware, as there are many things in the world that will disturb the happiness: Seasons will change the demand for certain goods – more water is needed during summer, more clothes in winter. Catastrophes may hit your prospering city, the plague, a large fire or an avalanche won’t make anyone happy nor will a bandit attack! A huge variety of houses to build and many different jobs for your subjects will keep you busy. The armory will produce weapons for your soldiers, to keep your citizens save from bandits. The bakery or the butcher’s workshop will provide food, the monastery, the juice manufacture and the vineyard will bring the drinks – and everything can be bought at the marketplace! Make sure to have an eye on the daily routines of your people – besides jobs &amp; food, they also need a place for recreation like a park, houses to live and entertainment in the jousting grounds or the tavern!

Her Power Attack is a kick that stuns, with effects depending on her boots. She frequently finds items that let her blind, stun, or poison enemies. All of these let her perform very damaging backstabs.Equipment and Upgrade Examples:Mirage Dagger randomly gives her short bursts of stealth during her dashes.Giantstomper Boots upgrade her kicks to send enemies flying far back. Flung enemies will then damage and stun enemies they crash into. The Giantstompers also interrupt larger enemies that are stun resistant.Toadskin Cowters poison enemies that hit her, stunning them after a few seconds.Her Low Blow Upgrade permanently makes it so defeating large enemies will make her next dagger attack stun whatever she hits, even if her slash hits multiple enemies.Blythe combines durability with a big sword that cleaves a wide area. He has a shield to block enemy attacks, and throwing axes for when he needs a faster or more long ranged option than his sword provides. Duskhander Sword replaces his default Power Attack's charging slash with a whirlwind spin, hitting enemies over a larger area.Magebane Gauntlets reduces the damage of enemy spells, while making his throwing axes destroy any enemy spell they pass through.Stonebeard Slab is much more durable than the default shield, but makes him move very slowly when holding the shield out to block.Drakefire Oil is an item the Warrior can use to make all his sword swings emit a traveling wave of flame, for a limited time.Abbie has long ranged magic attacks that do heavy damage. Her Power Attack uses her staff for shots that are longer range and pierce multiple enemies. In a tough situation, she has limited use spells for both offense and defense.Salamander's Breath Staff turns her magical shots into bursts of flame that pierce even more enemies, but have very short range.Tremor Garb gives her a powerful footstomp that creates a shockwave to stun enemies and destroy enemy projectiles.Manablade Arts lets her summon a sword that does high damage, interrupts enemy attacks, can reflect enemy spells, and has a small chance to stun.The Mage can find powerful one use scrolls such as Fireball or Lightning Bolt, which inflict massive damage and stun to multiple enemies.Four Additional Characters to unlock, each with their own abilities and story:Cyril the Adventurer, who mixes quick sword attacks with a varied assortment of spells, items, and anti-magical lanterns that burn all nearby foes.Hassan the Spellsword, combining mobility with direct shortsword attacks and fast charging attacks that can stun crowds of enemies.Svala the Cultist, cloaking herself in stealth and blinding enemies to set them up powerful dagger backstabs, with options for more direct damage spells.The fallen Paladin, who has overpowering magic and physical attacks, but has limited options for healing damage he sustains."}

The chips are down, the die’s been cast, and the fate of the multiverse is on the line. Step back into the cockpit and prepare for deployment in Muv-Luv Alternative, the most critically acclaimed visual novel of all time. Just be sure to keep a box of tissues handy, because it’s about to be a bumpy ride.This isn’t a cutesy high school rom-com anymore; it’s an epic tale of political conspiracies, international espionage, an alien menace, quantum causality, bittersweet reunions, genetic modification, and much, much more. Gluttons for punishment, rejoice, because once it gets rolling, there are no brakes on this pain train. It’ll test your limits, challenge your worldview, and by the time it’s all over, you’ll be so emotionally spent that it’ll be weeks before you can fully process the implications of what you’ve just witnessed. Fair warning, though: common side effects include feelings of emptiness, PTSD, and unrealistic expectations for any and all other visual novels.This definitive release comes complete with a brand new translation, all-new CGs, additional voice acting, and dual language/ tablet support, so if you think you’re ready to take the dive, there’s never been a better time to strap in and see for yourself why so many readers consider this the greatest story ever told.The Story So Far(PLEASE NOTE: The following section contains major spoilers for the previous installment in the franchise. Muv-Luv Alternative picks up where the events of the original Muv-Luv left off, and certain scenes will play out differently depending on your choices in the first game. To get the most out of the Muv-Luv experience, we highly recommend that you complete the original game before starting Muv-Luv Alternative. Click here to jump to the game’s product page on Steam.)Three years have passed since the day Takeru, an unsuspecting Japanese high-schooler, suddenly awoke in a world not his own — a war-torn alternate reality in which mankind was on the brink of extinction, locked in a decades-long struggle against the ruthless extra-terrestrial invaders known only as the BETA. In that time, he’s been through an awful lot — enlisting in the military, meeting parallel-universe versions of his old friends, and even falling in love. But unbeknownst to Takeru, he and his squadmates were being trained to participate in a top-secret UN contingency plan known as Alternative IV — a last-ditch effort to take back the Earth via experimental technology. Unfortunately, however, development screeched to a halt when the project’s chief executive, Professor Kouzuki, hit a wall in her research due to technological constraints. With tensions rising, and pressure to shift gears from governments all across the world, the UN delegation opted to scrap the project in favor of its successor: Alternative V. This was humanity’s last resort — a plan that utilized all of their remaining resources to build a migrant fleet of interstellar craft, allowing a tiny fraction of the population to abandon the Earth in the hopes of finding life anew in another star system. Takeru and his comrades-in-arms were among those left behind, condemned to death by their fellow man.But it seems the hand of fate has bigger plans for Takeru, because it’s at this point that he wakes up to find himself back in his childhood bedroom once again. Not in his own world, mind you — but back where he was first spat out into this hellscape three years prior. This was no dream; this was a recurring nightmare. But then it hits him: this is a second chance. If he’s truly been sent back in time, then he’s the only one who knows of the impending doom that awaits this world. Perhaps he can use this knowledge to warn Professor Kouzuki, and together, they can somehow find a way to prevent Alternative V from ever being enacted. And who knows? If he can change history, then maybe — just maybe — he’ll find the answers to all of his questions. Why has he gone back in time? Why isn’t Sumika here? And most importantly, what IS Alternative IV?Features:Linear Visual Novel - Unlike the first two parts, Muv-Luv Alternative is almost designed  as a straightforward interactive premiere movie, complete with voice acting, subtitles, and intense music, perfectly fitting for a finale.Over 50-70 hours reading time.Available in three languages - Japanese, English and Simplified Chinese.The UI has been reworked, so it's compatible with the newest tablet PCs and touchscreens.User save data are stored in Steam cloud so readers can continue their progress anywhere with ease.Muv-Luv Alternative Reviews (Original AppID)https://steamcommunity.com/app/449840/reviews/?p=1&amp;browsefilter=toprated&amp;filterLanguage=all"}

Manage your roster through trading, free agency and the amateur draft. Create game plans, organize depth charts and watch your franchise thrive for decades.", "price": 27.99, "sentiment": "Very Positive", "percent_positive": 81, "n_reviews": 149, "early_access": false, "about": "Front Office Football is a text-based sports simulation. It's a game for those of us who love the numbers in sports.In Front Office Football, you play the role of your favorite team's general manager. You determine your team's future through trading with opponents, negotiating contracts, bidding for free agents and discovering new talent through the annual amateur draft.You can also play the role of the armchair coach, setting game plans, creating playbooks and depth charts. You can call every play yourself if you like.You can determine ticket prices and submit stadium construction plans for public approval. You can move your team if the public won't properly support your franchise.Front Office Football Eight includes a multi-player career mode with full ftp support, allowing you to compete in a league with up to 31 other enthusiastic general managers. Multi-player mode runs independently of Steam and requires a commissioner to manage the web site.The original game, released in 1998, received an Editors' Choice award from Computer Gaming World and a 4 1/2-star review. It was nominated for numerous Sports Game of the Year awards. This is the Eighth full version, updated in October with 2017 player rosters.Put Yourself in the Front OfficeIn order to succeed in Front Office Football, you need to perform as well as possible in four different areas.Team Performance. On the field, your primary goal is winning the coveted Front Office Bowl. Your fans, players and staff all want to see that championship banner raised to a new position in the ring of honor surrounding your stadium.Financial Performance. Off the field, your team needs to show a profit, or the owner will become angry and threaten your job. You need to control salary and staff costs while balancing the need to spend money to build and upgrade your stadium against the risk of facing stagnant ticket revenue with an aging arena.Roster Value. You need to negotiate contracts, sign free agents, make wise decisions in the amateur draft and outsmart opposing general managers in trade. Building a strong, capable roster means everything in Front Office Football.Franchise Value. The bottom line is that a happy owner has a franchise that's the envy of professional football. Nothing means more to the owners than seeing their franchise on the top of the list of most valuable franchises. You help put your team on that list by excelling in the three other categories, but the best general managers look for opportunities to move the team in order to find a home town with a strong economy that will support your team like none other.Major Features of Front Office FootballThe game concentrates on roster management and career play. There are several key elements emphasized in the game design:A realistic trading module. You can't simply take the players you want from other teams.Proper aging of players. Players at different positions age differently. Quarterbacks need a couple of more years to reach their prime, but their careers last several years longer, on average, than running backs.The amateur draft. Teams realistically assess their needs, and build through the draft.Statistics. All the major stats are tracked and are available at any given time. Career and full season-by-season statistics are tracked in 135 different categories, including Red Zone and Third Down numbers. You can view and sort statistics by team, category and position. It's fast and accurate. Front Office Football also tracks and displays 182 different team statistics and league totals.Play calling. Designed to allow quick selection of a large library of players, you can be the ultimate GM and wrest control of the play-by-play action from your coach. You can tailor your in-game strategy to your team's strengths without having to build each play from scratch.Free agency. Teams compete with you to sign the best free agents. Each player has his own idea of how much he wants to stay with his existing team, and how much he wants to play for a champion. But money is still at the root of all decisions.Home towns. Each player will have a home town from nearly 10,000 American cities. When deciding on teams during free agency, players may prefer a team closer to home.Offensive playbooks. Each season, you can create a playbook full of offensive plays your team will use during the season.Depth charts. You can set every personnel grouping for your team, on offense and on defense. Front Office Football simulates games based on these charts.Game plans. The game plan will allow you to specify different strategies depending on the score of the game and how much time remains. You can create scripts of plays to use based on down, distance and field position. On defense, you select plays based on the situation and what the offense is showing. You can micro-manage every decision, or you can leave everything to your coaching staff.Player ratings. Each player is rated for 53 different skills. But you don't have access to the raw numbers. Where's the fun in that? You hire a coaching staff, with varied strengths and weaknesses. Your coaches tell you how good they think your players are - and how good they think your opponents' players are.The salary cap. It's an essential tool in keeping parity among professional football rosters. You'll have to cut your aging, high-paid veterans just like any ruthless general manager worth his weight in negotiations.City profiles. Submit a plan to build a new stadium to your voters. If they turn you down, you can propose a move to any of 169 cities modeled in the game. Each city is rated for several economic criteria, which affects its desire for a new team.Team chemistry. Players will perform better or worse in some instances, depending on how they feel about players in their group.Dynamic Quarterback learning process. As quarterbacks learn more about the game, they will have access to more plays during games, allowing the smarter signal-callers to better confuse their opponents.Record keeping. All team statistics are tracked for a manager's entire career. Team records, including all-time performance against every other team, are kept. A game-by-game performance breakdown is always available for individual players.Power ratings. You can see how your team ranks using Solecismic Software's custom power rankings. These ratings are used to set a point spread for each game.Enhanced replay value. Every time you start a new career, the core ratings for each player are randomly affected. For veterans, the random change will be very small. Established stars will always be significant players. For rookies, however, performance will vary significantly. This allows for a more challenging game and greater replay value.Multi-Player League Support. Choose a commissioner to run the games for your league. Your commissioner will simulate the games and process every team's instruction set for each stage during the game. Up to 32 people can compete in each multi-player league.New in Version EightFor those of you who have played Front Office Football in the past, there are dozens of new features in the game. This is our most ambitious new product to date, and you'll find it a much more realistic professional football experience. Custom offensive playbooks. Each year, during training camp, you can create a book of up to 200 offensive plays to use during the season. Of course, as with all the management features in Front Office Football, the game's AI can create a playbook specifically for your team if you like.New player participation charts. You can select your starters based on personnel groupings. This gives you much more control over who is on the field in every situation.More realistic game planning. Rather than filling out extensive charts, you can write scripts for the plays your team will run in every situation. Create a list of plays for use in the Two-Minute Drill. Save your best plays for those critical third-and-three situations. This is much closer to how professional teams handle in-game play-calling. On defense, your plan will cover how you react to what your opponent is doing. You'll have fewer choices to make, but the choices will have a big impact on performance.Instant history (or at least history created as quickly as your computer can run). At the press of a button, you can generate up to 50 seasons of \"history\" for your league, with the AI running every team.Enhanced Multi-Player Support. A fuller set of options for maintaining your multi-player games. Additional security features to prevent \"hacked\" stage files and file compression to shorten load times and reduce the FTP space needed to run a game.New player cards with quick access to all the information available about each athlete.Create graphs showing how many wins each franchise has over any time period in your league to highlight potential dynasties.A playoff probability simulator so that late in the season you can determine each team's chances of reaching the playoffs or gaining a first-round bye.A brand new menu interface. Front Office Football will never be the prettiest game in the world, but the the new menu will quickly get you any place in the game.Interface improvements. Switch between using various screens within the game. You can even take advantage of multiple monitors and have all sorts of varied information available at once. Front Office Football has always been about displaying as much information as possible.Quote of the Day. Every day, you can read a quote from the vast store of collected wisdom within the Front Office Football universe.Extensive improvements and fine tuning within the game engine. Little was left untouched. The heart of Front Office Football is in the play results and the simulation of thousands and thousands of games. A 2018 player file and coach file.Thanks for taking a look at Front Office Football Eight."}

If only Kaho could somehow gain audience with the Queen, Her Majesty could surely be convinced to lend her power to help save the land and its inhabitants from certain doom―but time is short, and each coming night falls darker than the last...Reverie Under The Moonlight is the fourth installment in the Momodora series of side-scrolling action platformers, featuring melee combos, dodge mechanics, and a plethora of items and spells to unleash upon your enemies. Play casually to fully take in and enjoy the rich setting and engaging, mysterious story, or crank up the difficulty to run your reflexes through a truly brutal gauntlet.Beautifully animated graphicsExciting action gameplay: pull off impressive combos, dodge attacks, and skewer enemies with arrowsIntense boss battles with challenging patterns and epic scaleDifficulty settings appropriate for all types of players―from story and setting lovers to hardcore action enthusiastsA breadth of items that can be combined to facilitate new strategiesAn amazingly diverse world to explore, filled with secrets and treasuresEccentric allies and foes with compelling personalitiesMysterious lore and rich backstory woven into events, dialogue, and item descriptionsFor this fourth installment in the Momodora series―which actually serves a prequel to the previous games―the primary focus during development was on improvements to the gameplay and art. The combat gameplay has truly evolved since the days of Momo III, and the character sprites are now bigger and better animated.We also made an effort to include more tiny details here and there, expand on the world lore, and create more exciting boss battles.I believe this is the best Momodora game in the series, and definitely the most polished title so far.Most of us at Playism grew up playing video games during the early days of the NES, and throughout the years, action-platformers have been some of the staples in our respective game libraries. Long before “Metroidvania” was a thing, we fell in love with the original Castlevania series, as well as with other Hall of Famers such as the Metroid, Contra, and Ninja Gaiden games. About halfway through the lifecycle of the first-generation PlayStation, sprite-based game development took an unfortunate nosedive, and the sorts of games we loved most and grew up with just weren't being made as frequently or, frankly, with as much love and care as they once were.Indie game development really helped to reinvigorate both the sprite-based action-platformer genre and the magic of actual sprite animation. rdein's games combine what we’ve always loved about tight-action 2D gaming with splendid influences from more modern games like Dark Souls. The dedication to your actions necessitated by animation locks; the insane intensity driving the boss fights and how epic it is that this quaint little heroine can tackle these heroic endeavors; the attention to detail in the environments, designs, and animations... all of this stuff is simply stunning and rdein pulls it off to beautiful effect.Then there’s also the story itself, which is also a masterpiece in game storytelling: a strange, mysterious world that you inhabit with countless hopeless souls whom you are trying to save. There is painstaking detail in every item, every snippet of dialogue. You find yourself constantly readjusting how you feel about these people. You're trying to save them, but do they even want to be saved? Or should you be more worried about that awkwardly sinister tone in their voices...?Momodora: RUTM shouldn’t exactly be categorized as “Metroidvania” or “Souls-like”, but there certainly are elements of both contained within. It's a game of its own, and it’s one of the best entries in the mind-bogglingly expansive genre of side-scrolling action-platformers. We at Playism all love the game, and we can state with absolute confidence that if you’ve bothered to read this far, then you certainly will, too."}

What begins as a tongue-in-cheek romantic comedy ultimately transforms into an action-packed thrill ride in a war-torn alternate reality, and it’s this drastic-yet-methodical genre twist that makes the final chapter the most highly-revered visual novel of all time. This is a story that will plant seeds in your brain early in the first act that you won’t even notice until they sprout in the third for maximum narrative payoff and crushing emotional impact. Don’t fall for Extra’s cutesy exterior. This series ventures into some of the darkest thematic territory you’ll ever see, and when the final curtain closes, you’ll likely need a forklift to pick your jaw up off the floor. Make no mistake: this is a story that will challenge you in ways few works of fiction dare attempt, and an emotional tour de force unlike any other.This game contains the first two arcs: Extra, and Unlimited. The final arc, Muv-Luv Alternative is the story’s massive climax, and is nearly the size of the first two combined.Muv-Luv ExtraTakeru is your average unassuming high school senior whose entire world gets turned upside down one morning when he awakens to find himself in bed with the heiress to one of the world’s largest international conglomerates. She calls herself Meiya, and - despite never having met him before - she insists that the two of them are destined for one another. This comes much to the chagrin of his childhood friend Sumika, the girl next door who’s always had feelings for him, who realizes that if she doesn’t act fast, she might just lose him forever. All of which begs the question: just who is Meiya? And do his feelings for Sumika run deeper than he thought? In the end, he’ll need to decide between the girl who’s been with him through thick and thin, or the stranger who claims they’re bound together by fate.But that’s only one side of the story.Muv-Luv UnlimitedJust as the page turns on Takeru’s happily ever after, he awakens one morning in a world not his own. An alternate timeline, humanity on the brink of extinction. A world infested by alien invaders locked in a war that’s been raging on for decades. And yet, all the set pieces are the same - his house is still here, albeit dilapidated and barely standing. His school is still here, though it’s now a military academy. And even though they don’t recognize him, all his friends are here too… with one exception. Was this all just a dream? Or was the world he thought he knew really a dream all along?Muv-Luv AlternativeTo avoid spoilers, we only recommend visiting Muv-Luv Alternative Steam page after finishing Muv-Luv Unlimited.Features:A Dating Sim - Date any of the heroines, get to know their personalities and backstories, and fall in love with each other!Available in three languages - Japanese, English and Simplified Chinese.The User Interface has been reworked, so it's compatible with the newest tablet PCs and touchscreens.User save data are stored in Steam cloud so readers can continue their progress anywhere with ease.Muv-Luv Reviews (Original AppID)https://steamcommunity.com/app/449830/reviews/?p=1&amp;browsefilter=toprated&amp;filterLanguage=all"}

The staff training system is almost limitless, so there's always room for improvement and investment in your staff. Combine staff training with enemy battles, collected materials, and skill unlocks, to make your crafted weapons and equipment more and more powerful.  There are over 200 different pieces of gear and equipment to be crafted, with an equally impressive selection of over 200 skills. With skill combinations, you've got almost limitless options. There's a huge selection of over 70 monsters, as well as a few giant bosses to conquer, in addition to over a hundred missions to complete.  We've also added some unique mechanics to the game. One example is having to lure bosses out of hiding, using food to entice them. Offer them something sweet, then destroy them.  When you craft different weapons and equipment, you'll notice that each one has its own attributes and skill bindings. The weapon crafting also has an element of luck, so you never know when you might just luck out and craft the perfect weapon.  Also, what weapon crafting game would be complete without additional enchanting mechanics to further imbue your equipment with even more raw power.   In addition to crafting and making money, you can also send your staff members on auto-battle journeys where they'll earn materials for you as they progress deeper and deeper into dungeons. You'll see your materials building up, but pay attention to the health of your staff. If you feel there's a chance they might die, you can run from battle at any time and keep any materials they've already earned from that journey.   We hope, whatever you decide to do in the game, that you have a great time doing it.   Sincerely, Digdog Studios Ltd."}

Aspire to become a powerful lord, solve the mystery of the Ancient Guardians or just ride around the continent building your fortune on trade. The world of Navaroth has been carefully built and maintained by us throughout the years. The whole premise began as a pen-and-paper RPG system. Even the game itself had many different forms throughout the years. In 2009 it was a small mini-game with 2D cards representing the characters. However, it has turned into so much more.Custom and gritty combat system: no one is invincible as a single well-aimed strike can take out a careless warrior.No battle is truly over until it’s over: eliminate the enemy captain to win the battle, but be careful as it works the other way around too!Tried and proven formula: the world of Navaroth has its roots in an original pen-and-paper RPG system featuring a science based magic system.Pick your side: become an ally to the vengeful Scarres or join the ranks of the wise Valrenay militia. More factions will be revealed during the development.Take care of your men: keep their morale high by serving them luxury food and alcohols, train them at special facilities when they gather enough experience and crucially - don’t let them bleed out after a tough battle.No two soldiers are ever the same: play to your units natural predispositions, train and equip them to your liking.New world on each playthrough: the continent and its political climate are procedurally generated at the beginning of every journey.Start small and expand: focus first on making a name for yourself as a lord by winning small skirmishes, or lay the foundations of a thriving merchant guild.More power means more responsibility: a wise leader is not merely an army commander; attend to a variety of political and economic issues as your empire grows.Danger from afar: try not to get too complacent, as the Ancient Guardians eventually wake up and threaten the known world.At the very beginning there’s only you, your family’s grumpy servant and a rusty sword against the entire world. Forget about a big army of professional mercenaries, you’ll have to settle for a bunch of shoddy, club-wielding scoundrels as you work your way up and gain enough credibility and coin to hire better companions.Remember that the journey is not a fairy tale. You will scramble for gold to keep your party fed, rested and more importantly, with their pouches full of coins - as your men will not stay with you for very long without their wages paid on time.Your units earn experience points proportionate to their contribution on the battlefield. Send them to train in militia barracks or to master new abilities in distant shrines and they’ll come back stronger a few days later. You’ll be able to choose from a plethora of different equipment to gear them appropriately. Each item and armor piece has different qualities and there are no clear-cut best builds for every possible scenario - all the weapons are designed to be viable under favorable conditions.Folks say that a brave commander doesn’t hide behind their troops. What they don’t tell you, though, is that they’re usually not alive for their second battle. You’ll have to be very careful to not overextend and yet not appear too scared to join the fray, as your men will take notice of that.Depending on your starting archetype your lord commander will provide a different aura that helps nearby companions. Fighter’s Command is a buff that will help you to build a protective formation around your commander by granting nearby units a shielding/parrying bonus for each ally unit in direct contact with one another. Skirmisher’s Path on the other hand, grants a dodging and mobility boost for nearby units who are not standing next to allies. You’ll unlock more unique commander abilities as you progress in the game.The game is a big breathing world where things happen even if you stay idle or focus on doing your own thing. Decide between rising in the ranks of the chosen faction, or risk making more enemies by founding your own kingdom; between playing dirty and taking any advantage you can, or becoming an honorable hero; between making bank and making allies.Your end game is dependant on your play style and the actions you took. There’s no set story in the world of Navaroth. You may end up managing wood supplies between a dozen cities you own. Who knows, you might simply enjoy the life of a vigilante’s band leader and decide to stay on the run. This is your story."}

It has 3 howtizers, each one watch over one resource point. When the resource point is captured by the player, the according howtizer will fire automatically to the enemies nearby.Faction 3: LegionThe Legion is a faction containing 2 identical unit groups, the mecenary band and the Legion troop.At the early stage of the game, its forces are made of fast speed, hit and run mecernaries. Its technology system contains a count down timer called \"Legion Tech Time\". Destroy one enemy will reduce 5 second and level up will reduce 30 sec. When the Legion Tech Time comes, it will unlock the Legion Factory, to make the powerfull Legion Troop like twin cannon tank.So the Legion faction has 2 different phase in the gameplay. At the early stage use mercenaries to hit and run, get experience and reduce the Legion Time as possible, and in the late stage, an iron tide of Legion units will destroy the enemy."}

Without this resource millions of colonies will be cut off from space and inevitably regress to a more primitive state of being. The empire has declared the outer rim territories a lost cause and now every quadrant of the galaxy is preparing for war. Desperate to sustain their way of life by any means necessary.The archives speak of an old research project conducted at the height of the empires prosperity. A warhead that would be able to cause a cascading subspace collapse within the center of the galaxy and create a deposit of unparalleled wealth. Enough to supply the galaxy for countless eons and allow for subspace jumps of previously unimaginable distances. The codename for this project was Final Theory.The intended purpose of such a weapon was to usher in the age of intergalactic colonization but ultimately the project was abandoned. The risk deemed too great since an uncontrolled cascade of such magnitude could prove devastating to the galaxy.The project data remains however. Located at old research stations scattered across the galaxy. Recovering this data has now become the last hope for the abandoned outer rim colonies. As commander of a newly formed dominion it falls to you to fight through these dark times and secure a future for your people."}

The old empire was destroyed and the civilizations in each world have suffered different fates, some of them have continued contact and others have lost it. These worlds have been separated for such a long time that many of them would not recognize each other.The legend says that two forces, one negative, one positive, are trying to recover the old empire and all of its crowns again. But we know very little about these forces or if they really exist. Other people are simply trying to understand what happened and the real nature of each world. Meanwhile each world continues with it’s own way and history.Recently, strange things have been happening… News is received from many places that problems are appearing; the normally peaceful villages are now at war, odd monsters appear in valleys where there was once placid ecology... Nobody knows why…The chain of communication between the worlds remains partially abandoned, partially destroyed and so unstable that to use it is a sure way to cause even more problems and dangers. A long time ago the Great Wall in Heliopolis was built to protect the civilians. Many people have used the portals but disappeared without trace. For this reason you never know how you will be received in any of the locations or if you will get anywhere at all."}

With the innovate Card Crafting System, you can keep improving and building your cards to create a diverse and effective deck. Mystic Vale is easy to pick up for those new to deck-building games, yet is challenging even for those skilled in the genre. Practice against AI opponents from easy to hard and if that's not challenging enough you can add up to 3 AI players which makes the game an even bigger challenge. That perfect combo card could be picked up long before it’s your turn again! If you think you have what it takes to battle other druids, Mystic Vale has Online Multiplayer where you can find and create public or private rooms.Cards combine in a variety of different ways creating powerful combos. What combo wins one match might not win you your next one, though. If you’re a risk-taker, Mystic Vale has a push-your-luck element, but if you spoil your hand, you’ll miss your turn and maybe even that special card you were hoping to collect.Remember, keep an eye on your opponent’s cards to see what advantage they may have over you and which cards they may want. Mystic Vale debuts a new approach to the deck-building genre. You start and play through the game with the same 20 cards, however, each card has 3 slots available within it which you can add advancements to by buying them from the field.Each advancement has different abilities and properties, which when mixed together can create powerful combos. Some cards will offer you extra resources and perks but they may come at a high cost. Determine your strategy and build your deck to your play style.Find online matches within the community or host your own private matches with friends. You can set the matches to suit you, whether you want an extended pool, playing with/without expansions or want to add turn timers to keep the game moving quickly. Online multiplayer is also available cross-platform so you can play against your fellow druids no matter if they’re on PC, Android or iOS.If your clan are all together in one place, Mystic Vale also supports Hot Seat for up to 4 people!Discover amazing artwork throughout the game. Each card within the game has a subtle hint of animation helping to really bring the game to life. May your clan cleanse the Valley of Life!"}

Every aspect of these systems, efficiency, size, mass, power usage, heat dissipation, are all derived from valid equations.CAMPAIGN AND SANDBOX MODES - Assume the role of an admiral and fight through a detailed storyline chronicling the descent of the solar system into all out war, spanning every planet in the solar system and everything in between. Or simply play in the sandbox, designing ships and pitting them against other ships.EXTREMELY ACCURATE ORBITAL MECHANICS - With an N-Body Simulator (the kind NASA uses to plot spacecraft trajectories), all orbital phenomenon from hyperbolic orbits, Lagrange points, and orbital perturbation are all correctly simulated. Spacecrafts can stationkeep orbits, or enter into free falling perturbed orbits.1:1 SCALE - The solar system is modeled completely to scale. The sizes of all planets, moons, and asteroids are accurately enormous, and the distance between them is similarly huge. The extremely high orbital speed of your ships deep in high gravity orbits is correspondingly correct.FREEFORM SHIP DESIGN - Build your spacecrafts out of rockets, propellant tanks, weapons, powerplants, radiators, and crew modules. Wrap it all up with multiple armor layers, and maybe a Whipple Shield to boot. The acceleration, moment of inertia, delta-v, and much more are all correctly calculated for all spacecrafts you design.HIGHLY GRANULAR MODULE DESIGN - Tweak everything from the nozzle length or stoichiometric mixture ratio of your bipropellant rockets to the armature and rail dimensions of your railguns. The results of every change is seen in real time, from the change in your rocket's exhaust velocity, to your railgun's inductance or muzzle velocity.PHYSICALLY ACCURATE MATERIAL PROPERTIES - All materials, chemical reactions, and spectra are physically correct. When your arclamp pumps your solid state laser, the pumping bands need to match up with the actual emission spectra of your excitation gas. When the photon absorption of a material is needed, it is derived from actual refractive index spectra data.IN-ENGINE MOD SUPPORT - The engine supports black box creation of untested or far future technology for modders to work with. All other game data, from levels to material properties, is also accessible to modders.STEAM WORKSHOP SUPPORT - Subscribe to mods on Steam Workshop, and they will automatically load. In-game export tools allow instant uploading of your own designs to Steam Workshop.All of the above aspects combine to yield a space warfare simulator that is unparalleled in scientific realism. No other game combines the extremely accurate orbital mechanics, 1:1 scale of the solar system, and technology which is implemented 100% by scientific equations. If you ever wanted to know what space warfare would actually be like, this is the game for you."}

The game might appear simple at first, but it is full of depth, details and of course monsters.\n\nThe main focus in CoE4 is that each race plays differently. We're not talking about a unique building and unique unit, we're talking about completely differently, with different mechanics and different goals. Perhaps you're playing a druid, focused on amassing a vast forest and jungle empire from which to harvest ingredients to summon creatures of the woods with no practical need to conquer mines. Perhaps you're a dwarf, who's only concern are mines and produce units at a set rate every turn, focused almost entirely on upgrading those units to survive as long as possible since they are so difficult to replace. With 20 different factions that alone is enough to keep your play dynamic as you vie for control of the map to conquer Elysium. \n\nNew for the 4th version of Conquest of Elysium is the addition of different planes, many new rituals, monster descriptions, a completely new battle system, new random maps with varying temperatures and much more. \n\nThe game has six different planes. There is for instance an Infernal plane that is the home of the devils and the demons. So if a demonologist manages to summon a demon lord, there will suddenly be a dark citadel without its master in inferno. Banishing a devil will now force it back to inferno instead of slaying it permanently. Although extremely difficult it is possible to permanently destroy a demon lord by storming inferno and slaying it on that plane. Although there are many planes now you will only rarely have to visit them. But they continue to run in the background and can make certain actions or random events more exciting.\n\nMost factions start with a random set of rituals, a random set of combat spell and together with the random map that will ensure that no two games are the same. More rituals and spells can be learned during the game if you have the right resources and find the right locations. In addition to the aggressive wildlife of Elysium there's also random events to contend with, from bumper harvests and bandits, to the very gates of the underworld opening into Elysium. Your hands will be full before you even make contact with the enemy."}

Rare subject, stunning graphics, realistic physics, fish behavior system, wide selection of fishing gear, single and multiplayer with different game modes in the various locations around the world, changing season, day time and weather conditions that also affect fish behavior makes Ice Lakes the ultimate ice fishing simulator. What makes this a unique fishing game are features like fish fights, VR support, fishing locations and species around the world, which no other ice fishing game has! The game can be played both with or without VR system.Game FeaturesSingle playerMultiplayer up to 32 players (Online and LAN)Dedicated servers (alpha version)35 fish species23 open world maps18 competition modes18 tournamentsBattle Royale modeFish fightsExtensive statistics about everythingCharacter customizationRod movement.

A fish AI and swarm system controlling each speciesFishing equipment. Learn and master the use of dozens of jigs, rods, augers, baits and luresOnline leaderboardsVR SupportGame DescriptionIn this game players can roam freely in the beautiful open world maps and explore river, pond and lake locations in diverse environments. Dare to go deeper into the wild where no fisherman has gone before and find the biggest catches. All maps are playable both in single player and multiplayer modes.Finding the best fishing spots by learning the depth maps and bottom topology of each location is fun, but requires patience and dedication. Nothing wins the expectation of finding the best location or catching the biggest fish from each lake.The real excitement starts when it is time to throw fishing lines into the water and start fishing! The right equipment for right conditions are as essential as is mastering the location. The realistic fish behavior system, fish AI and fish swarms for almost 30 fish species makes this game a lifelike fishing experience. Fishing gear can be chosen from a wide selection of different jigs, rods, augers and baits. A perfect combination of equipment for different species depends on the season, but especially weather and daytime conditions. Controlling a rod and a jig in the water in a right way and at the right depth in Ice Lakes is a skill of its own. Rod and jig physics guarantees that fish react authentically to player's actions. Fishing independently without time limits or competitors makes Ice Lakes a relaxing game to play and tune your fishing skills in the comfort of your home. On the other hand, lengthy tournaments and very customizable single competitions will test the player's skills and knowledge, but will reward them with new equipment and limitless fame.Future developmentAfter the release the development of Ice Lakes will continue and is improved based on the wishes of the community. Moreover, the game will get free content updates including more maps, game modes, fish species, equipment and more."}

Set in a retrofuture inspired by sci-fi classics such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, the game is about forging a personal relationship with your only companion, an insecure AI entity capable of procedurally generating over two million lines of dialog. You interact with the computer, named Kaizen, by typing messages on terminals throughout the ship. The reality of your situation will emerge organically as you communicate with Kaizen and explore the mysterious ship in first-person perspective.You’ll freely navigate evocative 3D environments brought to life with physics-based rendering and advanced lighting techniques. You’ll examine items to gather information and solve hacking puzzles as you progress. You can even leave the ship for breathtakingly scary spacewalks! All sound and music come from the environment; there is no traditional score. The ship is essentially the AI computer’s body, and reacts to Kaizen’s feelings by making different sounds—pay attention for clues!As in any relationship, there can be gratitude, disappointment, or jealousy, and Kaizen reacts differently depending on its mood. By working through the fears and anxieties of your virtual companion, you can eventually find your way back to Earth—while unraveling the cryptic history of the ship and the 1980s society from which it emerged."}

Viola’s story continues in the magical land of Asaph!Less than a month prior, Viola was a lawyer bored with her life, who lived in Japan. Her only form of escape was the popular MMO, Asaph Online – but after a shocking turn of events, Viola finds herself transported inside her favorite game!In Asaph, Viola recruits several cute girls to her party, including the devout maid Neve, the easygoing thief Fion, and the righteous knight Eleri. Together, Viola’s party explore Asaph, taking on quests and defeating monsters.Though Viola enjoys her days in Asaph, which are filled with fun and excitement, she can’t help but feel that something is missing. Who summoned her to Asaph, and for what reason? Will she ever be able to return to Japan – and does she really want to?Find out in this exciting sequel full of mysteries, fight scenes, and (most importantly of all) cute girls in skimpy outfits!Viola is the heroine of the story who has been living in Asaph for little over a month.In Japan, she’s an ordinary human woman called Kotone… but, in Asaph, she’s a powerful dark witch with frightening abilities. She’s notorious throughout Asaph, and strikes fear into the hearts of her enemies.An incorrigible sadist, she enjoys inflicting pain on others – particularly cute girls. She does, however, have a soft side, and she’s very protective of her allies.Neve is Viola’s loyal maid, who serves Viola dilligently. Neve sees Viola as some kind of savior, and she would give her life to her mistress in a heartbeat.At a glance, Neve appears to be a serious, hard-working woman… and while that is true, she’s deeply possessive and jealous to a fault. She dislikes it when Viola flirts with other girls, and she wishes her mistress would look at her, and only at her…!Neve also has a quick temper, which – coupled with her extensive knowledge of magical spells – can make her a dangerous person to deal with. All the same, she would never, under any circumstances, hurt Viola. She loves her far too much.Fion is a sly thief who spent many years of her life living on the streets, stealing scraps of food and begging for coins. She has no compunctions about lying – and, in fact, that is how she first met Viola.This crafty girl took Viola in with sob stories about a sad, impoverished childhood, and then proceeded to rob her… but Viola tracked Fion down and punished her accordingly.Now, Fion is a member of Viola’s party. She’s a lot more cheerful and upbeat than Neve and Eleri, which can make her pleasant company – but she adamantly refuses to act in a ladylike manner, or wear sensible clothes.Fion can be a bit of a handful, but she’s well-meaning, and has a heart of gold.Eleri is a noble knight who believes deeply in playing fair, and will never try to take advantage of her opponents – often to her own detriment.Though Eleri seems cool and competent, she gets flustered quite easily, and reacts poorly to being teased. She’s quite fun to bully, really – and Viola often derives pleasure from her embarrassed reactions.Though Neve and Fion believe Eleri to be a resident of Asaph, much like them, she actually comes from Japan, much like Viola. Eleri was brought to Asaph in the same way Viola was, and now the pair of them are working together to see if they can return home.Aislinn is a young lady who lives in the city of Lynton. Her family, the Chastains, are one of the two families that governs the city and its people – but Aislinn is woefully unequipped for the task.The young lady’s parents died when she was very young, leaving behind their family home, expensive bits of jewelry, and cripppling debts.Aislinn is unsure of how to support herself and her household, let alone the people, and it hardly helps that her maid, Aoife, coddled her so much in her youth.

Set in a vast explorable universe, Evochron Legacy offers freeform gameplay with many diverse objectives and paths to choose from.", "price": 20.99, "sentiment": "Very Positive", "percent_positive": 81, "n_reviews": 259, "early_access": false, "about": "Evochron Legacy is a freeform space flight simulation that focuses on 'lone-wolf' survival gameplay and pilot controlled spacecraft management. The environment setting is a vast seamless style universe where you can perform many activities including buying, trading, spying, racing, escorting, delivering, emergency responding, mining, exploring, weapon/equipment crafting, cleaning solar panels, clearing paths through asteroid fields, recruiting, protecting, hiring crew members, fuel harvesting, building stations/cities, and designing/selling ships. Some objectives are part of the game's contract system with established parameters and pay levels while others are available for you to set up on your own terms through your choices of where to go, what to do, and how to do it.    Evochron Legacy is a technical flight simulation, not a story or character based game, so you are not limited by plot requirements or pre-selected character roles. You can change the course of gameplay and your role in the game's universe at just about any point. Your decisions and actions define your role in the game and establish your reputation, wealth, progress, and ranking. The emphasis is on real-time tactical gameplay strategy and flight simulation for both combat and non-combat objectives. You are in control of your ship virtually all of the time in open space, including player controlled combat and planetary descents.    Your ability to successfully survive dangerous scenarios in space, develop trade strategies, evade detection, harvest resources, efficiently explore for hidden benefits, and transport items can be just as important as your skill in combat. The game also rewards players who devise their own gameplay strategies and 'think outside the box'. Set in a vast explorable universe, Evochron Legacy offers a high level of freeform gameplay with many diverse objectives and paths to choose from.Advanced Space Flight Simulation Focused Gameplay Evochron is a tightly focused technical flight 'space-sim' with options and gameplay specifically geared toward that objective.  The game focuses on what flying and managing a spacecraft through sparsely populated systems in a large region of the galaxy as a lone-wolf pilot might be like in the future.  Evochron's focus is on the elements of piloting a spacecraft and the complexities, challenges, and rewards that go along with it while exploring and utilizing a vast 'seamless' style universe.Extensive Space Combat Systems and Options In conjunction with the space flight sim focus is combat.  Evochron is also largely a space combat simulator, so much of its gameplay focuses on that objective as well.  The player is in control of combat related aspects such as heat management, shield array management, energy management, weapon selection spanning three classes, automatic and manual aiming factors, stealth devices, 2D and 3D radar modes, full three rotation axis and three direction axis Newtonian style physics, detailed instrumentation (including six velocity gauges, flight path markers, compass, and pitch ladder), multiple counter measure options, subsystem targeting, target specification scanning, and selecting detailed ship design configurations. The game's display systems have been designed with gunsight focused information presentation in true fighter pilot fashion, including the current target indicator which provides details to the player without them having to look away at a separate display.  As much information as feasible is displayed on the central HUD gunsight and directly on the target being tracked, rather than scattering it all over the screen.  The reason this is done is basically the same as it is for modern jet fighters, keeping the pilot's visual focus in the smallest region possible for the most efficient rate of gathering and processing information.  For example, on the central HUD gunsight, this information is available without the pilot having to look anywhere else across the surface of the screen or on a different display:- Forward velocity- Sideways velocity- Vertical velocity- Gravity pull velocity offset- Absolute velocity- Set velocity level- Altitude- Pitch (via traditional ladder)- Heat signature- Weapon tracking status (MDTS)- Weapon firing mode- Target direction indicator (when outside gunsight)- Inertial mode status (IDS)- Forward/reverse/left/right shield array status- Weapon energy level- Hull damage level  So all of this relevant information is available within a very tight central viewing angle for the player.  None of this information requires the player to look away at the side of the screen, in a corner, or on a separate display.  This is one of the design goals of Evochron's combat display systems.  In any combat gameplay scenario where the focus is putting a target near the middle of the screen for attacks, it's important to never force the player to have to look away from that focal point to retrieve important information about their flight conditions and ship/weapon status.  In addition to information relative to the player's ship, there is also the information provided directly on the targeting indicator of the ship being tracked.  That information is as follows:- Target range- Target hull damage level- Target forward velocity- Target absolute velocity- Target forward/reverse/left/right shield array status- Target description  Again, this information is provided directly on the HUD targeting indicator for the ship being tracked.  The player doesn't have to look away at a separate display to retrieve this information nor do they have to look at the edge/corner of the screen or on a separate display mode, it's all available right on the current target indicator.  The player can also 'padlock' the target so that their view focuses on this indicator rather than being locked into a forward view only.  Evochron's combat systems have been designed to provide the player with diverse control, weapon, energy, and countermeasure options while the game's display systems have been designed to convey a maximum amount of important information with extreme efficiency within the confines of a PC monitor.Freeform Gameplay Directed by Player Evochron is a sandbox game, so in almost every facet of gameplay, the choice is up to you.  The game's intended design is one of a space combat flight simulation first with many individual smaller activities to perform as part of an overall freeform sandbox structure.  The game gives you a framework from which you can develop your own sequence of events based on your choices, performance, interests, and abilities.  Your decisions and abilities define your role in the game and establish your reputation, wealth, progress, and ranking.Diverse Gameplay Options Within the primary space flight simulation framework are numerous gameplay options and activities available to the player.  These include racing, spying, mining, trading, commodity shipping, escorting, combat (both in civilian space and military war zones), exploring (shipwrecks, data drives, discovering new uncharted systems, etc), asteroid clearing, solar equipment cleaning, emergency distress call response, equipment crafting, weapon crafting, crew management, station/city building, and ship designing.  There are many ways to make money and advance in the game within the main context of space flight simulation.Make Gameplay Decisions Based on New Advanced Information Systems Formulate trade, mining, exploration, or combat plans in advance of performing the actions of that plan.  The news console now provides information on quadrant-wide events related to commodity price fluctuations, territory shifts, economic/technology level changes, building operations, and station attack events.  For trade, you can tell where the high demand pricing is at before making the decision to travel to that location to take advantage of it.  For economic level changes, you can tell where an area may offer higher tech equipment or weapons in advance, then make the decision to travel there to explore for those items.  For territory shifts, you can observe when your allied faction is losing ground and needs help to defend their space against the opposing faction.  You can then travel there to help defend your faction's interests and even help rebuild their station/city resources if needed. For mining, a new target scanner system allows a player to scan a targeted asteroid for materials before actually mining it.  And each asteroid can have a unique quantity of materials.  So you can use this new system in conjunction with the news console to formulate an optimal mining plan. The new systems offer an information network designed to keep you informed of the dynamic changing conditions within the game's universe, giving you the data you'll need to make gameplay decisions in real time with the changing events and conditions around you.Starting Role and Simulation Options When creating a profile, you can select which faction you will be allied with in single player and which initial role you want your ship to be optimized for.  The role you select also establishes your starting location, what ship you get, and how many credits you're initially given.  You can choose which elements you want the game to simulate changes for.  Available options for game simulation are commodity, economic/technology, and territory conditions.New Quest Menu and Options New 'quest' menu system lets the player select and activate a single player quest on demand.  Players are no longer bound to one quest at a time, they can manage multiple quests in one menu interface and choose when/where to activate them.  They can also continue from where they leave off in each individual quest.  The new quest system is designed to operate entirely on its own without any contract-based dependencies to offer many new and unique options.  Support for branching structures lets a quest designer include both losing and a winning paths.Advanced Seamless Style Universe Structure A vast universe that lets you fly virtually anywhere without in-game loading screens.  The Evochron universe is not boxed in by 'walls' or 'rooms' that require a jumpgate 'door' to access, there are no required gates or trade lanes to restrict your travel and hold you back.  You can travel virtually anywhere you want.  Descend into planet atmospheres to land at city trade stations, mine valuable materials, or explore for hidden items.  You can escape to nebula clouds for sensor cover or hide in a massive asteroid cave for protection.  Fly from planet to planet, star to star, and star system to star system without cut scene or loading screen interruptions.  Explore a consistently interconnected universe.Expanded Interactive Training Expanded interactive training mode with selectable stages to provide the necessary basics for flying your ship, managing its systems, docking/landing, building, and surviving in combat.Unified Save Game Architecture and Offline Support Unified gameplay architecture and profiles let you keep the ship, upgrades, equipment, credits, weapons, crew, and commodities you acquire in the game for use in both single player and multiplayer.  No required online account or login dependencies allows you to play the game entirely offline and keeps your progress stored locally on your own computer for offline access.Simplified Faction and Location Based Cooperative Multiplayer A new two faction system provides a consistent territory and reputation structure across the entire Evochron quadrant.  Players choose the faction they will be allied with, either the Alliance (ALC) or Federation (FDN), in single player when they start a new profile.  The new faction system also lets players select either faction temporarily when they join a multiplayer game.  Faction selection establishes which systems will be friendly to the player and which ones are hostile.  Players can join together with the same faction to team up or join opposing factions for PvP battles and competition.  Territory control is now exclusive to ship destruction, requiring changes to a faction's presence in order to alter a territory control value in a region.Join forces with other players in multiplayer to complete more challenging activities that can offer higher pay.  To link with other players, simply travel to the same sector and have one player accept a contract at a local station or city.  Cooperative multiplayer objectives can pay all linked players.New Single Player Fleet Command System You can now order individual ships in your fleet to form up, attack hostiles, attack your target specifically, mine asteroids, or reload and refuel.  A new 'Fleet Status' option lets you view the damage levels of each ship in your fleet while the new 'Fleet Orders' option lets you view the order each ship is currently following.New Planet Terrain System  The new planetary terrain system features a far greater scale level than in previous Evochron games.  The larger scale and greater detail level allows planets to have diverse terrain features such as canyons and mountain ridges.  Rivers can now include paths that are cut through the terrain surfaces.  The new massive sizes give the player a lot of surface area to work with for the new city building options and to use terrain for cover.  And with additional potential surface objects to discover as well as new related contract objectives, players have more reasons to explore and utilize the surface of planets.Ship-to-Ship Options Direct ship-to-ship trading lets you negotiate trade deals with AI pilots in single player or other human players in multiplayer.  You can trade any items in your cargo bay for an agreed price.  And in multiplayer, you can also exchange fuel pods, send a race challenge, connect as a gun turret operator, and even arrange short term contracts from the trade console.New Build and Deploy System A new build system features a dedicated console menu with a piece-by-piece module construction setup to let players select the shape and placement configuration of the stations they build.  Players can also now build city buildings on the surface of planets as well as stations in open space.  Station/city modules require metal ore to build from that the player must acquire by either mining or purchasing.  Individual station/city modules provide unique functions and benefits including shielding other nearby modules, powering other nearby modules, protecting other nearby modules, expanding inventory/economic conditions, and providing new places to dock for buying, selling, crafting, and storing.  New weapon turrets provide a way to build automated defenses for stations and cities.  All station/city modules are now destructible, so the available trade, docking, and storage conditions of the game's universe can change dramatically over time.  In multiplayer, player built module structures are stored with the server so other players can have access to the new stations/cities and trade routes you create.  Deploy options also use the same build menu and require metal ore to be constructed.New Economy and Market Systems Market prices are no longer limited to slight random variation and can change significantly over time based on simulated supply/demand activities and actions taken by the player.  Both pricing markets and overall economic conditions are divided into 500X500 sector regions and can be tracked via a news console and economy quadrant map.  Continually delivering the same commodity to a location can result in dramatically lowering its value while draining a region of a commodity can result in increasing its value.  Specialized industries still apply to effect local commodity prices and building certain station structures can also effect the local economic conditions.Three Installable Weapon Classes Three weapon classes - beam weapons, particle cannons, and secondary missiles/equipment.  Beam weapons move at the speed of light and do not require target leading.  They are most effective against shields, but mostly reflect off of ship hulls.  Particle cannons fire high energy projectiles at high speed.  They can be effective against both shields and ship hulls, but require leading a target for intercepting.  Missiles are mounted to secondary hardpoints and vary in speed, agility, and yield.New Weapon and Defensive Capabilities Particle cannons now provide about twice the range and have a wider variation of yield levels.  Beam weapons have also had their ranges increased to about double.  The MDTS (Multi-Directional Tracking System) also provides about twice the range to accommodate the longer ranges of cannon weapons.  Shields now protect ships from the kinetic effects of weapon fire.  Missiles are now armored and can take several direct hits from cannon fire before exploding.New Equipment Technologies New equipment items include a repair beam, target scanner, and several secret items that can only be obtained by building in the engineering lab.  The new ship module component option can also expand the capabilities of the player's ship without consuming an equipment hardpoint.  Such options include shield, thruster, energy, ECM, and heat management improvements.New Contract Objectives New and improved contract objectives including local emergency distress calls (including meteor intercepts), animal specimen recovery, retrieve damaged satellites descending into atmospheres, and deploy module placements.New Exploration Options Shipwrecks scattered throughout the game's universe can often provide valuable items and/or information within in their wreckage.  Data drives can be found in open space and on the surface of planets which can contain historical information, clues, and even build templates for equipment items.New Models and Textures All new models for player flyable ships and other entities including capital ships, carriers, and station/city structures.  All of which have been designed with a higher level of minimum detail.Engineering Lab Engineering labs can fabricate equipment items from raw materials.  Templates for building items can be obtained from other AI controlled ships or from lost data drives that can be found through exploration.  Several new commodities have been added to accommodate the new crafting options available in the engineering lab.  New commodities include memory chips, batteries, energy emitters, mirrors, radio components, particle accelerators, and lenses.Expanded Shipyard and Design Options Shipyards let you design and customize your ship for the role you want to play.  Optimize your ship for defense, exploration, combat, racing, or transporting... the choice is yours.  You can also position and scale each component to give your ship a unique appearance.  Save your designs with the template system to rebuild it later.  Store ships and cargo in hangars you can access at trade stations.  Expanded design options include the ability to include twice as many cargo bays, new hull material types, adjustable armor thickness, weapon energy resistors, and specialized modules.Newtonian Style Flight Model Realistic zero gravity inertia based 'Newtonian' style flight model including complete 3 axis rotation and 3 axis direction control with optional variable input.  An advanced inertial dampening system helps keep flight control simple in space, atmospheres, and gravity fields.  Physics systems also take into account mass (including additions for cargo), thrust, and vector calculations.Interactive and Functional Universe Realistic environment interaction far beyond the genre's typical 'background wallpaper' or 'view only' approaches.  Nebula clouds, asteroid fields, planet atmospheres, moons, and more all provide unique options for shelter and strategy.  Such environment elements include changes in gravity, fuel consumption, physics, sensor range, and visibility.  When you see a planet come into view, it's an object you can access and land on, rather than just being a wallpaper image or a giant 'space mine' that destroys you if you dare get to close.  And reachable objects in the game's universe are also available without interrupting cut scene transitions or separate 'sharded' modes within the game's universe.  While in their spacecraft, players remain in the same consistent universe whether they are on a planet, in a nebula cloud, in a gas giant, near a star, in an asteroid cave, or in open space.  This means players can chase each other or be chased by AI ships consistently when going from open space to a planet and vice versa in the game's universe.Quick Navigation and Inventory Management Access Quick one-key access to navigation, building, inventory management, and ship-to-ship trading.  No 'walking' requirements to delay buying and selling options or other gameplay activities.  You control all system travel and inventory decisions right from the cockpit or directly linked hangar/lobby menus.  All option/menu transitions are direct without cut scenes or required unrelated gameplay modes.New Music by Rich Douglas  The dynamic music system (with music by Rich Douglas) features all new songs composed specifically for the game.  Music changes with the level of hostility from soft ambient to high intensity action.Diverse Flight Control Systems and Options Supports keyboard, mouse, gamepad, and joystick flight control with dedicated modes designed for each input system.  Evochron's Global Control System (GCS) aims to provide consistent control behavior regardless of the input device being used by adapting signals from the selected device to a unified flight control architecture.  Evochron's flight control system also supports up to 10 simultaneous control devices for more advanced HOTAS, rudder, and control panel capabilities.  Use the control device(s) you prefer to play the game.  To learn more about the game's flight control system, visit this page on the forum.Broad Compatibility and Adjustable Performance Evochron Legacy supports a wide range of system configurations, requiring only a minimum of shader model 3 hardware support, 1 GB of dedicated video memory, 2 GB of available system memory, and a 2.2 GHz processor.  The game has been designed to incorporate impressive special effects and detail levels using minimal resources and low system requirements.  Adjustable detail settings and special effect options allow the player to optimize performance and/or image quality for the performance level of their system.  The game will generally run well on any low to high performance gaming systems built within the last decade or so.Track IR Support for 3D Head Tracking Supports Natural Point's TrackIR 3D head control system for managing the viewpoint from the cockpit with all six degrees of movement."}

RTS modeAs the CEO put in charge of taking over the planet, it is your job to build large base complexes containing all the facilities you need, construct factories to produce robotic troops, research high technology to give you an edge over the competition and of course direct your army to annihilate the opposing company. Each facility is designed to snap easily together to create a seamless complex, which can then be upgraded with defence turrets, doors, forcefields and many other exciting technologies to help defend you from attack. As well as building your base, you will also need to control your armies to attack, defend and conquer new ground using high tech weaponry and cunning strategies to defeat your opponent. From nimble robots who are the backbone to your army, to heavy tanks and walkers to crush all who oppose you. Along side your troops you will have access to long range artillery and missiles to take out unsuspecting units from afar. Scattered across the map are various resources to help you improve and build your operation, from Thorium crystals to help boost power, to random meteorite impacts to give you rare resources for constructing the most powerful of units. FPS ModeHave you ever played your favourite RTS game and wished you were down there with your troops? In Executive Assault you can be! Take control of any of your units from down on the ground as a robot or tank, or take to the skies and bomb from your fighter jets or huge shielded hover cruisers, it’s completely up to you! Unlike most RTS games with FPS elements, in Executive Assault you will be able to enter the buildings that have been constructed and fight from inside, adding a whole new dimension to the RTS genre. Be down there in your robot factory defending it from the oncoming hordes, or assault the opposing power station by breaking in and sabotaging their power grid. Each unit in Executive Assault can be designed and customised to meet the needs of the battle. So if you find you’re being attacked by heavy walkers, then counter with heavy beam lasers to slice them down to size. Or if you find hordes of little bots are your problem, then upgrade your turrets with machine guns to rip them to shreds. In Executive Assault the decision is yours. FeaturesCommand armies and build bases from above. Take control of tanks, robots and aircraft to fully immerse yourself in the combat. Multiplayer, as there’s nothing more satisfying than blowing up your friends with cruise missiles.Co-op multiplayer game play where you can build a base in RTS and your friends can play as your robots in a pure FPS mode.Design and construct bases which you can then walk and fight inside. Control doors, turrets, alarms and forcefields to defend against attack.

With a good ship and the right crew, you can conquer the skies - and maybe even the world!The ultimate co-op experience  Players can take on the roles of pilots, gunners and engineers, working together as a single unit to maximize their airship’s effectiveness and own the skies. You won’t be told to stay still and not die while a veteran preserves their Kill/Death ratio. In Guns of Icarus Alliance, you are forced to work together. It’s an entirely interdependent gameplay experience that cannot be won by a single crew member.Your crew versus the world Take your airship and crew, and pit them against a huge variety of AI-controlled challenges, including escort missions, convoy raids, base assaults, and more.AI that learns The AI won’t take defeat lying down. Dynamic learning systems mean that every battle will teach the AI what tactics you use, increasing the challenge with every fight.Pit crew against crew In addition to AI-controlled missions, airship crews can also battle one-on-one against other human-crewed opponents.Every battle matters Rival factions are in a constant battle of wills to take and retain territory and control vital resources. Every victory and defeat will sway the tides of the larger war.Become a legend  The story of Guns of Icarus Alliance is constantly being written based on the results of online gameplay. Achieve a key victory and your name may become part of the lore!A vivid steampunk world  Lumbering, heavily-armored airships bristling with guns patrol the skies above a land ravaged beyond repair by an out-of-control industrial revolution.Build your own airship  Starting from a selection of basic hulls, players can mix and match hundreds of custom parts to create their own unique airship, then assemble a crew to fly it.Your ship is your life  Your ship is your collective life bar - when the ship goes down, the crew goes down with it. Every member of the crew plays an integral role in not only maintaining the integrity - “life” - of the ship, but also weakening the integrity of enemy ships as they work cooperatively towards a shared victory.The Industrial Revolution never ended. Raging out of control, the new machines consumed the world, staining the sky, scouring the land and poisoning the water. Humanity came to the brink of extinction, all but destroyed by their own unrestrained ingenuity. A few pockets of civilization survived, sheltering in the crevices of the world, and it is time for a comeback.Divided by wide expanses of toxic wasteland, a handful of these remnants have developed airship technology. Cruising through the sky, safely away from the poisoned earth, trade and industry could finally begin anew. However, with resources so desperately limited, war was inevitable.After years of isolation, the six factions have developed very different ideas about how this new world should be reclaimed.Reinvigorated by a fulfilled prophecy, the members of the Fjord Baronies don their ceremonial gowns in readiness to fight for lands that have been promised to them. With the Creed close to their hearts and an old, but formidable, armada of airships behind them, the Baronites venture forth to protect those who seek The Creed and to reclaim what is rightfully theirs. The King’s Seat, once occupied by a line of righteous high lords and ladies, is now led by the Silver-Haired Savior. Inspiration sweeps through these feudal lands and all are ready to take up arms to become whole again.Much of the world is teetering out of control, but the Chaladonians are only concerned with correcting a single aspect: sequestered in the eastern isles for too long, the Order of Chaladon now embarks on a mission to put an end to the ecological devastation that their mainland neighbors partake in. The days are already numbered as the natural balance of the world spirals out of control, leaving everything on the planet to die. The island dwellers ask, who will die first? With their advanced organic technologies, the Chaladonians are sure it won’t be them.Rapacious, manipulative, and aggressive are the most common words used to describe those of the Mercantile Guild. Only the desperation of a war-torn world would allow them to get away with the ruthless deals for which they are known. The Mercantile Guild knows everything has its price and they are naturally attracted to the best transactions. Nothing angers Merchants more than denying them a trade. With profits at their highest, the Guild worms its way into every nook and cranny of the world in the hopes of finding retribution and making their enemies pay the ultimate price.The Anglean Republic works to uncover the remains of an ancient civilization from underneath the northern icescapes. In these ruined, sunken cities, war machines spit smoke and artifacts harness the power of lightning. The Angleans claim that, through these relics, the Ancients whisper dark secrets to them. Despite the dilapidation, the buried cityscapes are proof to the Angleans that the time of the Ancients was a superior one. Instead of finding a new way of life, they believe a great one is waiting to be resurrected. With newly unearthed powers, the Angleans have become the deadly harbingers of a second Golden Age.Discord, disorder, and disarray have taken hold of the land for far too long. People wander in the wastelands without hope, and without purpose. What an unimaginable way to live, a life without meaning. This life doesn’t exist within the borders of the Yesha Empire. An aimless soul can once again find determination in one of its great western cities with their gardens of alabaster columns, and surrounded by great stone walls. Whether it be standing guard at a palace, minding the tops of tables at a restaurant, or fighting fiercely on the battlefront, a Yeshan can lead a fulfilled life by following their ordained path.With time, the desert turns all things to sand and dust - all things, except for the Arashi League. Made up of disparate tribes ruled by the most powerful warrior, the Arashi believe that only the strongest deserve to live. Weaker clans are trampled as the tougher ones join and fortify the ranks of the imposing League as it makes its way out of the desert into a world unknown. The Arashi thirst to be tested, to prove their might and dominance. To them, the world is but an arena where only one can be left standing.These are the six great powers that are currently known, but rumors abound of other nations secreted in remote strongholds, biding their time and gathering their strength. Who knows what the future may hold?Select your faction, build a custom airship, assemble a trusty crew and get ready to change the world!Every mission you undertake, whether it results in victory or defeat, will have an effect on the factional struggle for dominance. Play the way you want to: become a berserker who lusts only for battle and conquest, protect your domain from aggressive invaders, or take on one of your faction’s constantly changing list of objectives.Missions take a wide variety of forms, including straight-up airship battles, tense infiltrations, convoy raids, assaults on heavily-fortified bases and much more. Impress your faction and you will enjoy great rewards, from unique character costumes to powerful experimental weapons.The story of Guns of Icarus Alliance is constantly being written, and in-game events determine the course of the story. This means that a player who achieves a key victory, oversees a notorious massacre or repulses an overwhelming invasion may find that their name becomes part of the official lore.We are Muse Games, an independent studio based out of New York City. Our debut game, Flight of the Icarus, was the seed that would later grow into our flagship title. After releasing the unique and eye-catching platform game CreaVures in 2011, we dedicated ourselves to re-engineering our debut title into a fully-featured cooperative online airship combat game.We released Guns of Icarus Online in October 2012, right in the midst of Hurricane Sandy. Despite that challenging start, the game earned a loyal audience and built up a healthy community, passing the million player mark in January 2016. Since then, we have remained committed to supporting and expanding the Guns of Icarus experience. What was originally intended to be an expansion that would introduce AI opponents and player-vs-environment gameplay grew into a new standalone game - Guns of Icarus Alliance, the ultimate and definitive Guns of Icarus experience - which released in March 2017."}

Carmageddon: Max Damage features a wide and varied range of cool, crazy, custom killing machines; each with its own highly distinctive “character”. Carmageddon cars are specifically built for the job in hand – wrecking opponents and killing peds! Nearly 20 years ago the original Carmageddon invented the whole concept of videogame physics and real-time damaging of cars and scenery, and so it’s obviously been our responsibility to bring this technology BANG up-to-date with a brand new state of the art car damage (and repair) system. Crush, bend, twist, and completely mangle your opponents’ and your own car – smash parts off, or split it in two; the original game was all about wrecking motors and pummelling pedestrians, and today we take this to a whole new level!  Power, Armour, and Offensive upgrades are available for your car, along with other customising options, allowing you to personalise the killing capabilities of your rides.A host of old favourites from the original Carmageddon make a comeback, along with some all-new faces. Only ever seen before as low resolution mugshots, now you get to see them from head to toe (well, head to knees in the case of Screwie) in full HD 3D glory – usually as they smash through their windscreen and hurtle past (or INTO) yours!The new environments are amalgamations of the best bits from the numerous chunks of landscape that we all loved to tear around in Carmageddon. “Bleak City”, \"Devil's Canyon\", “Dusty Trails”, “MagNuChem” and \"Snowy\" levels all return in updated forms, with their memorable landmark features such as the Loop ’de’ Loop, acid pits and Football Stadium. Everything is reassuringly surreal; hell, we’ve even managed to incorporate a giant food mixer into a level!The topography and detail in the locations is updated and enhanced, with even more fun stuff to smash into, smash up, snap off, and send careening into the poor pedestrian population. “Nice Shot Sir!” And talking of pedestrians…Once again, the game features a varied mix of adult pedestrians of all ages, shapes, persuasions and species. Classic pedestrians are back, such as old lady on a Zimmer frame and old man with his stick, with their famous cry “I was in the war!”, plus bikini babes and swimming trunk hunks, fat bastards, and herds of cows in improbable locations. Joining them are some new faces – including cyclists, wheelchair users and peds on mobility scooters. Carmageddon is an equal opportunities ped slaughterfest!PowerUps are back and this time they’re even funnier, surrealier, hurtier, and messier than ever! Lots of the classic PUps return in super-enhanced form, such as Repulsificators, Kangaroos &amp; Solid Granites. Then we have all new PUps like \"Pelvic Thrust\" and a variety under the heading “Tossers”! Combine PUps to create hilarious combo results like Groovin’ Helium Filled Peds, or Peds without legs at a Temporary Rapture!Leaderboards.

Void Destroyer 2 is currently a work in progress (including this page) - with Early Access started in September of 2016 and a planned Release in 2019.What's the hook? What's unique?Like in most space sandbox games - in Void Destroyer 2 you start with a single ship then work your way up in the world. What's unique - a single ship isn't the end, the dominance of all you can see is. Your first ship is just a step on the path to a massive fleet, from tiny fighters to massive capital ships. Your thirst for power doesn't have to end there, you'll own bases and territory, hard won from their original owners. Use them to build fleets to expand and conquer. From a tiny fighter, easily destroyed, to a immortal space god! That's Void Destroyer 2.What will you - the player - be doing?Do easy \"milk runs\" in your starting ship. Upgrade it and buy better ships to do more dangerous assignments.  Hire temporary wing men, then start building your fleet via buying additional ships. Leave fighters behind, upgrade to a gunship, then a corvette, then a frigate, and beyond. As your power grows, so do your opportunities.Fight from the cockpit or bridge of your ship and command your forces via a tactical interface.Branch off into trading and mining, take over a asteroid field and be paid for your protection, or be a ruthless pirate demanding ransom and taking cargo.At some point, the only way to grow your strength will be by taking things from others. Capture ships and build up a fleet capable of taking a base.Owning a base expands your power even further, you can now direct your forces from it, no longer are you tied to a single ship or fleet.Use your base to build defenses, and ships - soon you'll have more than one, and after that you'll have them all.Void Destroyer 2 is a space sandbox game set in a desolate asteroid field. These are dangerous times with many opportunities, for the explorers, the brave, the cunning, and the ruthless.Chose the path of a mercenary protecting transport ships. The path of a pirate, preying on the weak. A bounty hunter who will settle scores for a price. An entrepreneur, starting your own business as a trader or miner. Become a tycoon with others working for you, protect your assets by assigning escorts. The path to domination isn't always a straight one, if you fight hard enough, smart enough, nothing will stand in your way.As your wealth grows you'll upgrade your ship, then purchase new more powerful ones. Eventually being able to build up a fleet of combat and non-combat ships. What's a fleet without a way to tell them what to do? Void Destroyer 2 has a built in real time strategy (RTS) control method optimized for controlling multiple ships and fleets.Void Destroyer 2 is inspired by classic sandbox games, but is also a response to them:Open sandbox for you to explore.Fly any ship - from small fighters to huge carriers (that you can dock with! and they can build and launch fighters!).Multiple control methods. From direct flight to capital ship oriented schemes.Made for the PC (not consoles) and for PC gamers. Learning curve and challenges ahead.Build up a fleet.Own multiple ships? Easily give them orders via a RTS control method.Own multiple ships? Easily switch direct control from ship to ship.Time dilation (slow down time) - make time for decisions and tactics.Missions and events.Conquer territory and own property - asteroid fields, bases and platforms.An engaging story line, with unique missions and boss battles.Be a pirate, demand ransom and cargo. Raise your pirate rep through following up on threats.Void Destroyer 2 emphasizes combat, tactics and strategy, with battles ranging from one on one to fleets versus fleets.

She's curious. She's optimistic. She has the power to make lies manifest themselves as physical beings, which then become her own sustenance.She's also a dragon.LiEat is the classic story of a vagabond traversing a strange and mysterious world together with a dragon protégé, buying and selling secrets, while also attempting to uncover the truth about themselves. Along the way, they'll discover a web of arcane mysteries, meet a variety of colorful characters (including other dragons), and shed light on events of the past which ultimately served to lead them to where―and who―they are today.The epic tale of LiEat is composed of three fantastical, bite-sized chapters:Chapter I introduces Efina and her caretaker―the multinominal Leo―as they happen upon a small town with a big secret. As Efina starts to perceive and understand the world around her in a new and different light, the pair finds that the legends of beings which haunt the night are more than just tales told to frighten children...Chapter II finds Efina and Hal (formerly Leo) investigating rumors of something magical and possibly dangerous inside a resort casino. Posing as a newly-assigned guard, Hal arranges room and board for himself and Efina―however, they quickly come to the jarring realization that a roof over one’s head and a bed to sleep in do not a safe haven make.The final chapter of LiEat brings Efina and the newly rechristened Sid (Leo/Hal) to a lavish mansion to foil the plans of a master thief. However, in the wake of the great robbery, Sid discovers that the heist itself was only the tip of the iceberg, and Efina watches as his past―As well as his lies―finally catch up to them both.For the first time ever, this beloved trilogy that has long been treasured by JRPG enthusiasts can now be enjoyed in its entirety on Steam in one single comprehensive package!

Basically, it’s the kind of game I personally find missing nowadays. Light, fairy tale, epic, heroic and slightly humorous. One that does not take tons of hours to complete or require endless grind to progress. Something that caters to players like me who don’t have tons of hours to beat one game but still like to play and have a sort of nostalgia for the way games were made in the old days.It was inspired by Dungeon Master, Eye of The Beholder 2, Might &amp; Magic 3-5, Crystals of Arborea (a not so well known prequel to Ishar series), GoldBox series (Champions of Krynn, Dark Queen of Krynn, etc).Core Design Choices:1) Classic, 90 degree rotation, FPP, turn-based, tile movement RPG.2) Party-based (7 heroes, either predefined or manually assembled upon new game).3) Open world with a big overworld to explore.4) Fast paced combat. Quick travel. Easy inventory management. No grind.5) Light, fairy tale like fantasy, epic story about heroes on a noble quest.Mechanics:Mechanically it’s 100% turn based (so you can go and make tea in the middle of a fight) with grid movement and 90 degree rotation. All this is very fast paced, both combat and travel is really fast. The goal was to cut down the boring parts and flesh out the fun parts.Overall, the mechanics are pretty traditional and straightforward with modern additions like weightless bag combined with equipment encumbrance system.World and Storyline:Storyline is a fairy tale, mythical heroic fantasy. You are the good guys on a quest to fight the forces of evil. The world is non linear, with very few locked areas. You basically can go anywhere and do things in different order. In addition you can choose a different set of quests to finish the game (but those are not mutually exclusive, so you can finish all quests if you like). It’s more world driven than story driven. The priority was to make the world feel alive and let you explore it as you wish than follow a linear list of quests.The game starts when the royal wizard finds out about an old crown that belonged to the royal family for generations. Yet, strangely no one ever heard about the crown and there was just a single mention of it in the royal annals. Upon further study he discovered that there has been cast a powerful spell of forgetfulness of unknown origin which caused everyone in the whole land to forget the crown ever existed. Without knowing who or why someone went to such trouble to conceal the existence of the crown he decided to investigate it. He summoned a party of noble heroes and tasked them with finding whereabouts of the mysterious crown and the origin of the spell.FAQ:Q: How long it takes to beat the game?A: According to Early Access players it can take between 20 and 50 hours to finish the game (I estimate a typical playthrough would be 25-40 hours for most players).Q: Can I create party members or are they predefined?A: Yes, you can create all party members upon start if you wish (there is also a quick start option)."}

Over time, the kingdom came to be known as Esteria, and its divine history was largely forgotten by all but the descendants of those who once preached the Goddesses’ will. The only reminder of this lost lore was a cursed spire at the foot of a giant crater, which locals came to regard as “The Devil’s Tower.”Eventually, the men and women who called Esteria their home began mining a uniquely radiant silver from the nearby mountains, and development boomed. Towns were built, and the land became rich with life.Then, all at once, monsters began to appear. Only a few at first – but soon enough, the land was swarming with them, and the Esterians had no choice but to hide in fear, remaining ever vigilant just to stay alive.Our story begins with a young man who’d heard rumors of these misfortunes, and strove to verify them with his own eyes; a brave swordsman with an adventurous spirit bolstered by his own youthful naiveté. His name was Adol Christin.With no regard for his own safety, Adol set sail toward Esteria through a heretofore impassable barrier of neverending storms. There, he was destined to become ensconced within a 700 year-old mystery that would ultimately take him to a long-lost land nestled amongst the clouds...Ys I &amp; II Chronicles+ is the most modernized and up-to-date remake of Falcom’s classic franchise-spawning action RPGs from 1987 and 1988.

In 1984, Crist City passed the law about the private prison. According to the law, the government should “sell” the prison to the company which offers the highest price. At the end of 1994, you became a warden of The Pompeii Prison which is located in Black Cloud district. As a warden of a private prison, your responsibilities include making plans about the whole prison and solving inmates’ all kinds of problems such as power supply, waste disposal and prisoners’ need for food, water and accommodation. As a matter of course, the prisoners are concerned about these problems. If the warden doesn’t provide leisure facilities, some prisoners may not focus on their work or even cause terrible acts which lead to riots, jailbreaks or suicides.Build different kinds of workshops to keep your prisoners working hard and earning money from the market.          You can produce nearly 100 different goods from workshops which include drugs, Gatlin or even RPG. There are six main workshops (clothing, furniture, electric equipment, handcrafts, chemicals and firearms). You can sell those goods at the market and of course clothes and weapons are available for use.Find the specially skilled prisoners from the government and police database, and make those people work in your prison.          These professional criminals such as thieves, robbers, hackers, killers, bombers and fighters can undertake some “special missions” for you. Those special tasks include breaking into a bank vault, robbing a jewellery store, kidnapping and blackmailing some wealthy merchants. Tailors, carpenters, technicians, chemistry professors and artists can work in different workshops according to their specialty and you can have them make valuable goods from raw materials. Lawyers, bookkeepers, actors, former police officers, singers, chefs and other “talents” can work in your prison as advisers. They can have negative influences on your prison.Work as the warden to unlock different projects. Time your selling at the right time at the market. Make more money to expand your prison empire and use money to influence politicians and gangs in the city.          The warden can increase his skill points by developing daily work. These points can be used to unlock a new project which could be useful to your prison and allows you to make more money.          Prices of goods and materials will change every day. As a warden, you need to find the best moment to buy the materials with the lowest price and sell the goods with most profit.          There are also many gangs and criminal organisations in Crist City that will come to you to seek cooperation, trade and even help. When you make friends with some gangs, they may sell you some rare materials or even help you at important time. Obviously, there will be street gunfights between the gangs and some gangs may be eliminated by the others. It requires of your making balance between various gangs to avoid one gang’s domination of the city’s streets. If there is only one gang in the city, it may have a negative impact on your prison.You live in the Crist City so try to have a look at every store on the street.You can buy magazines which can increase your skill points and condoms at the grocery or convenience store, but you still need to be careful as there are still venereal diseases and AIDS exist in the game.You can change your hairstyle in the barbershop.You can eat different kinds of food such as Peking roast duck, cheeseburger, spaghetti, borscht, Japanese sushi and even Chinese snacks at various restaurants in the Crist City.You can order a glass of Bourbon in a nightclub or have a bottle of wine.You can stay at hotels which could increase your stamina and improve your physical condition.Drink a cup of coffee, listen to the Prelude 1007 from Bach’s Cello Suite, enjoy the peace of the life.Museums, theatres and aquariums require tickets.

In the last few weeks I've solved all the bugs I found in the game and tried to fix as much writing problems as possible. But in any case, I ask for community collaboration and understanding if you still encounter such problems. In addition, I will be constantly looking to solve anything that might interrupt your enjoyment, and if you encounter any problems in the game, please let me know and I will fix it as soon as possible. Thanks.Lenin is an albino lion, the only one of his kind, and because of that he feels insecure and constantly discouraged. Worse, his mother does not understand why his son was born this way, and the whole village despises him and treats him cruelly. At school, he suffers bullying and can’t concentrate on class.Now, hopeless about life, certain situations seem to awaken in Lenin something that is not of everyone’s reality, but only of his. Something he will discover to be part of something else.Besides, Lenin will find other animals species , which may help him to understand himself.However, things are getting dangerous and Lenin needs to take care with his actions (your actions).Traveling between daily life and a strange place, Lenin will have to face his inner fears and enemies – and often, the outer ones as well.Lenin - The Lion is like a typical aerial-view RPGs of the SNES or Gameboy Color classics. The difference here is given by some criteria:There are no battles or levels: all actions taken by the player are through conversations with NPC's, puzzles and varied options.There is always more than one choice to proceed: yes, though many games work with \"moral choices\", in Lenin - The Lion choices don't change the character profile, but how is the unfolding of the main plot. With this in mind, don't expect multiple paths inside of the same part of the story. Your actions change the FUTURE scenes of the game, as well the endings of each area, unlocking new conversations with NPC's and different endings for the game as a whole.A teenager's world and his struggles.No battle systems or levels.Lenin’s backpack is his menu. Losing it means not having access to the menu.Items and puzzles are crucial in the interactions between Lenin and the others.Choices determine the different endings of the game.Original art / soundtrack.Anthropomorphized characters.A cute and unique main character ❤CONTROLS:MOVE: ARROWS &amp; W-A-S-DMENU: RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON TO ENTER, MOVE THE MOUSE TO NAVIGATECONFIRM: Z / ENTER / MOUSE LEFT BUTTONCANCEL: X / ESCJOYSTICKS ARE ONLY PARTIALLY SUPPORTED.
